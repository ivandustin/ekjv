Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
All the souls that came from the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was already in Egypt.
And Joseph died, along with all his brothers and all that generation.
The children of Israel were fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Now there arose a new king over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.
Come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass that, when any war breaks out, they join our enemies, fight against us, and so escape from the land."
Therefore, they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.
The Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigor.
They made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and brick, and in all manner of service in the field; all their service, in which they made them serve, was with rigor.
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.
He said, "When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.
The king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this thing and saved the male children alive?"
The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are lively and give birth before the midwives arrive."
Therefore, God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very mighty.
It came to pass that because the midwives feared God, He made them houses.
Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, "Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."
