The entire congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, following their travels as commanded by the LORD, and camped in Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
Consequently, the people quarreled with Moses, saying, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
The people were thirsty there for water, and they complained against Moses, asking, "Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "What should I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
The LORD instructed Moses, "Go ahead of the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; take in your hand the rod with which you struck the river, and go."
"Behold, I will stand before you on the rock at Horeb; you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
He named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the children of Israel and because they tested the LORD, asking, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.
Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
So Joshua did as Moses instructed and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, but when he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Moses' hands grew heavy, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and the other on the other side, and his hands remained steady until sunset.
Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
The LORD said to Moses, "Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, for I will completely blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
Moses built an altar and named it Jehovahnissi,
For he said, "Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
