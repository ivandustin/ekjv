Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, saying, "I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea."
The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will prepare a dwelling for him; he is my father's God, and I will exalt him.
The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea; his chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea.
The depths have covered them; they sank to the bottom like a stone.
Your right hand, O LORD, is glorious in power; your right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.
In the greatness of your majesty, you overthrow those who rise against you; you send forth your wrath, which consumes them like stubble.
With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were gathered; the floods stood upright like a heap, and the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils; my desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them."
You blew with your wind, and the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them.
In your mercy, you led forth the people you redeemed; you guided them in your strength to your holy dwelling.
The people will hear and be afraid; anguish will grip the inhabitants of Palestina.
Then the chiefs of Edom will be amazed; the mighty men of Moab will tremble; all the inhabitants of Canaan will melt away.
Fear and dread will fall upon them; by the greatness of your arm, they will be as still as a stone until your people pass over, O LORD, until the people pass over whom you have purchased.
You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for your dwelling, in the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.
The LORD will reign forever and ever.
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the LORD returned the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women followed her with timbrels and dances.
And Miriam answered them, "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea."
So Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur; they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
When they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore, the name of it was called Marah.
The people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
He cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; when he cast it into the waters, the waters became sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he tested them,
And said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his sight, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon you that I brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the LORD who heals you."
Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
