On that night, the king could not sleep, so he commanded that the book of records of the chronicles be brought; and they were read before him.
It was found written that Mordecai had informed about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to harm King Ahasuerus.
The king asked, "What honor and dignity have been bestowed upon Mordecai for this?" The king's servants who attended him replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
The king then asked, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.
The king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman stands in the court." The king replied, "Let him come in."
So Haman entered. The king asked him, "What should be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?" Haman thought to himself, "Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?"
Haman answered the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,
let royal apparel be brought that the king wears, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown that is set upon his head.
Let this apparel and horse be delivered to one of the king's most noble princes, so they may dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and lead him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'"
Then the king said to Haman, "Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate; let nothing fail of all that you have spoken."
Haman took the apparel and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor."
Mordecai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
Haman told Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His wise men and Zeresh said to him, "If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him."
While they were still talking with him, the king's chamberlains arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
