And Solomon resolved to construct a house for the name of the LORD, as well as a palace for his kingdom.
Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to carry burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to supervise them.
He sent a message to Huram, the king of Tyre, saying, "Just as you assisted my father David by sending him cedars to build a house for him to dwell in, please do the same for me."
"Behold, I am building a house for the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to Him, to burn sweet incense before Him, to provide the continual showbread, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an everlasting ordinance for Israel."
"The house I am building is great, for our God is greater than all gods."
"But who is capable of building Him a house, considering that the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I, then, that I should build Him a house, except to offer sacrifices before Him?"
"Therefore, send me a skilled man who can work with gold, silver, brass, iron, purple, crimson, and blue, and who can engrave with the skilled artisans who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided."
"Also, send me cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Lebanon; and my servants will work alongside yours."
"This will ensure that I have an abundant supply of timber, for the house I am about to build will be extraordinarily great."
"Furthermore, I will provide your servants, the woodcutters, with twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, twenty thousand measures of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
Then Huram, the king of Tyre, responded in writing to Solomon, saying, "Because the LORD has loved His people, He has made you king over them."
Huram continued, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, and who has given David the king a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, to build a house for the LORD and a palace for his kingdom."
"And now I have sent you a skilled man, endowed with understanding, from Huram my father."
"He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father is a man of Tyre, skilled in working with gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, purple, blue, fine linen, and crimson; he is also capable of engraving any design and finding out every device that may be required, along with your skilled artisans and those of my lord David your father."
"Now, concerning the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that my lord has mentioned, let him send them to his servants."
"We will cut wood from Lebanon as much as you need, and we will transport it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you can then carry it up to Jerusalem."
Solomon counted all the foreigners in the land of Israel, following the census that David his father had conducted, and they were found to number one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
He appointed seventy thousand of them as bearers of burdens, eighty thousand as stonecutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to manage the work.
