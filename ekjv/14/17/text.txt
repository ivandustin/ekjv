And Jehoshaphat, his son, reigned in his place and fortified himself against Israel.
He stationed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa, his father, had captured.
The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the early ways of his father David and did not seek after Baalim.
Instead, he sought the Lord God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not imitate the practices of Israel.
As a result, the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, and he amassed great wealth and honor.
His heart was uplifted in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and groves from Judah.
In the third year of his reign, he sent his officials, including Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
Along with them, he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, as well as priests Elishama and Jehoram.
They taught in Judah, carrying the book of the law of the LORD with them, and traveled throughout all the cities of Judah to instruct the people.
The fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms surrounding Judah, so they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat.
Some of the Philistines also brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute silver, while the Arabians presented him with flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred he-goats.
Jehoshaphat grew exceedingly powerful and built castles and store cities in Judah.
He had extensive business dealings in the cities of Judah, and the mighty men of valor were in Jerusalem.
These are the numbers of them according to their ancestral houses: from Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the chief, accompanied by three hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
Next to him was Jehohanan the captain, with two hundred eighty thousand alongside him.
Next was Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, accompanied by two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
From Benjamin, Eliada, a mighty man of valor, led two hundred thousand armed men with bows and shields.
Next to him was Jehozabad, with one hundred eighty thousand ready for battle.
These served the king, in addition to those whom the king assigned to the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
