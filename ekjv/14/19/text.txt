And Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned to his house in peace in Jerusalem.
Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the ungodly and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore, the LORD's wrath is upon you."
Nevertheless, good things have been found in you, for you have removed the groves from the land and prepared your heart to seek God.
Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim, bringing them back to the LORD God of their fathers.
He appointed judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.
He said to the judges, "Take heed to what you do, for you do not judge for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in judgment."
Now, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and act accordingly, for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor favoritism, nor acceptance of bribes.
Furthermore, in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and the heads of the families of Israel for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies when they returned to Jerusalem.
He charged them, saying, "Thus shall you act in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and with a perfect heart."
And whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in your cities, regarding bloodshed, law, commandments, statutes, and judgments, you shall warn them not to trespass against the LORD, so that wrath does not come upon you and your brethren; do this, and you will not trespass.
Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael is the ruler of the house of Judah for all the king's matters; the Levites shall also be officers before you. Act courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.
