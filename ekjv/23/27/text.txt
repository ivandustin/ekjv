On that day, sing to her, "A vineyard of red wine."
I, the LORD, will tend to it; I will water it every moment. To prevent any harm, I will protect it night and day.

And it will come to pass on that day that the LORD will gather from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.
And it will come to pass on that day that the great trumpet will be blown, and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, will come and worship the LORD on the holy mount at Jerusalem.
