And in that day, seven women will cling to one man, saying, "We will provide our own food and wear our own clothes; just let us be called by your name to remove our disgrace."
In that day, the branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the produce of the earth will be excellent and appealing for those who have survived in Israel.
It will come to pass that those who are left in Zion and those who remain in Jerusalem will be called holy, every one whose name is written among the living in Jerusalem.
When the Lord has cleansed the impurities of the daughters of Zion and has removed the bloodshed from Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of purification.
And the LORD will create over every dwelling place on Mount Zion and over her gatherings, a cloud and smoke by day, and the radiance of a flaming fire by night; for the glory will serve as a protective covering.
There will be a shelter to provide shade during the day from the heat, and a place of refuge, as well as a cover from storms and rain.
