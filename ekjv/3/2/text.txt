When anyone offers a grain offering to the LORD, it shall consist of fine flour; he shall pour oil on it and place frankincense upon it.
He shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests, who will take a handful of the flour and oil, along with all the frankincense, and the priest shall burn this memorial portion on the altar as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
The remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is most holy among the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
If you bring a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall consist of unleavened cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
If your offering is a grain offering baked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil.
You shall cut it into pieces and pour oil on it; this is a grain offering.
If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour mixed with oil.
You shall bring the grain offering made from these ingredients to the LORD, and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
The priest shall take a memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar; it is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
What remains of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is most holy among the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
No grain offering that you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you shall not burn any leaven or honey in any offering made by fire to the LORD.
As for the offering of the firstfruits, you shall present them to the LORD, but they shall not be burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
Every grain offering you present shall be seasoned with salt; you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering; you shall offer salt with all your offerings.
If you offer a grain offering of your firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer green ears of corn dried by fire, even corn beaten from full ears.
You shall put oil on it and lay frankincense upon it; this is a grain offering.
The priest shall burn the memorial portion, part of the beaten corn and part of the oil, along with all the frankincense; it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
