As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.
As the bird wanders, as the swallow flies, so the curse without cause shall not come.
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the fool's back.
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also become like him.
Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.
He who sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks damage.
The legs of the lame are not equal; so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
As he who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool.
As a thorn goes into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools.
The great God who formed all things rewards both the fool and the transgressors.
As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.
Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
The slothful man says, "There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets."
As the door turns on its hinges, so does the slothful man turn on his bed.
The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it back to his mouth.
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can give a reason.
He who passes by and meddles in a strife not belonging to him is like one who takes a dog by the ears.
As a madman who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
So is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not in sport?"
Where there is no wood, the fire goes out; so where there is no talebearer, strife ceases.
As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
The words of a talebearer are like wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
He who hates disguises his hatred with his lips and lays up deceit within him;
When he speaks kindly, do not believe him, for there are seven abominations in his heart.
Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the whole congregation.
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; and he who rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
A lying tongue hates those it wounds, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
