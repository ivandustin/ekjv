The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, like rivers of water; He directs it wherever He wishes.
Every man believes his own way is right, but the LORD weighs the hearts.
To execute justice and judgment is more pleasing to the LORD than sacrifice.
A haughty look, a proud heart, and the actions of the wicked are all sin.
The thoughts of the diligent lead only to abundance, but those who act hastily will find only lack.
Acquiring treasures through deceit is vanity, tossed about by those who seek death.
The wrongdoing of the wicked will lead to their destruction, for they refuse to uphold justice.
The path of man is perverse and strange, but the work of the pure is right.
It is better to live in a corner of the rooftop than to share a house with a quarrelsome woman.
The soul of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his sight.
When the scorner is punished, the simple gain wisdom; when the wise are instructed, they receive knowledge.
The righteous man wisely observes the house of the wicked, but God will overthrow the wicked for their evil deeds.
Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out but will not be heard.
A secret gift calms anger, and a reward given in private pacifies strong wrath.
It brings joy to the just to execute judgment, but destruction awaits those who practice iniquity.
The man who strays from the path of understanding will remain among the dead.
He who loves pleasure will become poor; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
The wicked will serve as a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
It is better to live in the wilderness than with a quarrelsome and angry woman.
There is treasure and oil to be desired in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man squanders it.
He who pursues righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness, and honor.
A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold of its confidence.
Whoever guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
The proud and haughty scorner is his name, who acts in proud wrath.
The desire of the lazy kills him, for his hands refuse to work.
He covets greedily all day long, but the righteous give and do not hold back.
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more so when he brings it with a wicked intent?
A false witness will perish, but the man who listens speaks with integrity.
A wicked man hardens his face, but the upright directs his path.
There is no wisdom, understanding, or counsel against the LORD.
The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but safety comes from the LORD.
