The LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Designate cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses:
So that anyone who unintentionally kills another person may flee there; these cities shall serve as a refuge from the avenger of blood.
When someone flees to one of these cities, they must stand at the entrance of the city gate and present their case to the elders of that city. They will take him into the city and provide him a place to live among them.
If the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not surrender the slayer to him, for he struck his neighbor unintentionally and had no prior hatred for him.
He shall remain in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time; then the slayer may return to his own city and house, to the city from which he fled.
They designated Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah.
On the east side of the Jordan, near Jericho, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness, belonging to the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, belonging to the tribe of Manasseh.
These were the cities designated for all the children of Israel and for the foreigner residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally kills another person may flee there and not die at the hands of the avenger of blood until they stand before the congregation."
