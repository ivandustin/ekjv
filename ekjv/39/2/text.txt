And now, O priests, this commandment is directed at you.
If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart to give glory to my name, says the LORD of hosts, I will send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: indeed, I have already cursed them because you do not take it to heart.
Behold, I will corrupt your offspring and spread refuse upon your faces, even the refuse from your solemn feasts; and one will carry you away with it.
And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, so that my covenant might be with Levi, says the LORD of hosts.
My covenant was with him concerning life and peace; and I gave them to him because he feared me and was in awe of my name.
The law of truth was in his mouth, and no iniquity was found on his lips: he walked with me in peace and righteousness, and turned many away from iniquity.
For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
But you have departed from the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts.
Therefore, I have made you contemptible and lowly before all the people, because you have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law.
Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?
Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
The LORD will cut off the man who does this, both the master and the scholar, from the tents of Jacob, and anyone who offers an offering to the LORD of hosts.
And you have done this again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with cries, to the point that he no longer regards the offering or receives it with goodwill from your hand.
Yet you ask, "Why?" Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously: yet she is your companion and the wife of your covenant.
And did he not make them one? Yet he had the residue of the Spirit. And why one? So that he might seek a godly offspring. Therefore, take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
For the LORD, the God of Israel, says that he hates divorce; for one covers violence with his garment, says the LORD of hosts: therefore, take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.
You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you ask, "How have we wearied him?" When you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them"; or, "Where is the God of justice?"
