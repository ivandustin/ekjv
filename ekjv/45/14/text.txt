Receive those who are weak in faith, but do so without engaging in disputes over opinions.
One person believes they can eat anything, while another, who is weak, only eats vegetables.
Let the one who eats not despise the one who does not eat, and let the one who does not eat not judge the one who eats, for God has accepted them.
Who are you to judge another person's servant? It is to their own master that they stand or fall. Indeed, they will be upheld, for God is able to make them stand.
One person considers one day more important than another, while another considers every day the same. Each person should be fully convinced in their own mind.
The one who observes a day does so for the Lord; and the one who does not observe the day does so for the Lord as well. The one who eats does so for the Lord, giving thanks to God; and the one who does not eat does so for the Lord, also giving thanks to God.
For none of us lives for ourselves, and no one dies for themselves.
If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
For this reason, Christ died and rose again, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
As it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
So each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
Therefore, let us stop judging one another, but rather make this judgment: not to put a stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother.
I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if someone considers something to be unclean, for them it is unclean.
If your brother is hurt by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not let your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died.
Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil.
For the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by others.
Let us pursue what leads to peace and mutual edification.
Do not let your eating destroy the work of God. All food is clean, but it is wrong for anyone to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble, be offended, or be weak.
Do you have faith? Keep it between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn themselves by what they approve.
But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
