Now the Philistines engaged in battle against Israel; the men of Israel fled from the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons relentlessly; they killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
The battle pressed heavily upon Saul, and the archers struck him, wounding him severely.
Saul then said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it; otherwise, these uncircumcised men will come and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.
Thus, Saul, his three sons, and all his household perished together.
When the men of Israel in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled; the Philistines then came and occupied them.
The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
After stripping him, they took his head and armor and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines to deliver news to their idols and to the people.
They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
all the valiant men arose, took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, brought them to Jabesh, buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted for seven days.
Saul died because of his transgressions against the LORD, specifically for not adhering to the word of the LORD and for seeking counsel from a medium to inquire of it;
he did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore, the LORD killed him and transferred the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
