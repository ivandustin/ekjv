When David grew old and had lived a full life, he appointed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
He assembled all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites.
The Levites were counted from the age of thirty and above, and their total number was thirty-eight thousand.
Among them, twenty-four thousand were assigned to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, while six thousand served as officers and judges.
Additionally, four thousand were designated as porters, and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments that David had made for that purpose.
David organized them into divisions among the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
The Gershonites included Laadan and Shimei.
The sons of Laadan were Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel, three in total.
The sons of Shimei were Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran, three; these were the heads of the families of Laadan.
The sons of Shimei included Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; these four were the sons of Shimei.
Jahath was the chief, and Zizah was the second; however, Jeush and Beriah had few sons, so they were counted together with their father's house.
The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, totaling four.
The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses; Aaron was set apart to sanctify the most holy things, along with his sons, forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to Him, and to bless in His name forever.
Regarding Moses, the man of God, his sons were from the tribe of Levi.
The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
Shebuel was the chief among the sons of Gershom.
The sons of Eliezer included Rehabiah as the chief; Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were numerous.
The chief among the sons of Izhar was Shelomith.
The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
The sons of Uzziel were Micah the first and Jesiah the second.
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
Eleazar died and had no sons, only daughters, and their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them as wives.
The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, totaling three.
These were the sons of Levi according to their family houses, the heads of the families, counted by name and number, who performed the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty and above.
David declared, "The LORD God of Israel has granted rest to His people, allowing them to dwell in Jerusalem forever."
He also stated that the Levites would no longer carry the tabernacle or any of its vessels for service.
By David's final instructions, the Levites were counted from the age of twenty and above.
Their role was to assist the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, chambers, and in the purification of all holy things, as well as in the work of the house of God.
This included responsibilities for the showbread, fine flour for grain offerings, unleavened cakes, baked goods, fried items, and all manner of measurements and sizes.
They were to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.
They were to offer all burnt sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts, according to the prescribed order, continually before the LORD.
They were also to maintain the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, the holy place, and the duties of the sons of Aaron, their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
