And it came to pass that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret.
He saw two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
He entered one of the ships, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to thrust out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the people from the ship.
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."
Simon answered, "Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net."
When they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish, and their net broke.
They beckoned to their partners in the other ship to come and help them, and they came and filled both ships, so that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
He was astonished, and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken.
So were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Fear not; from now on you will catch men."
When they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all and followed him.
It came to pass that when he was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy saw Jesus, fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
He put forth his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." Immediately, the leprosy departed from him.
He charged him to tell no one, but to go and show himself to the priest and offer for his cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
But the fame of him spread even more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
He withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed.
It came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
Behold, men brought in a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought means to bring him in and lay him before him.
When they could not find a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up on the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
When he saw their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
The scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, "Why do you reason in your hearts?"
"Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise up and walk'?"
"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins," he said to the paralyzed man, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
Immediately, he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
They were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."
After these things, he went forth and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me."
Levi left all, rose up, and followed him.
Levi made him a great feast in his own house, and there was a great company of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.
But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus answered them, "Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick.
I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
They said to him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days."
He spoke also a parable to them: "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise, the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old."
No one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will perish.
But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
No one having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, "The old is better."
