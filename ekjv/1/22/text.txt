And it came to pass after these events that God tested Abraham, calling out to him, "Abraham!" He replied, "Here I am."
God instructed him, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah; offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will show you."
Early the next morning, Abraham got up, saddled his donkey, took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. He chopped the wood for the burnt offering, then set out for the place God had told him about.
On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
He said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there to worship and then return to you."
Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac his son. He carried the fire and the knife, and the two of them went on together.
Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, saying, "My father!" Abraham replied, "Here I am, my son." Isaac said, "Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
Abraham answered, "God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering." So they both went on together.
When they arrived at the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there, arranged the wood, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, saying, "Abraham, Abraham!" He answered, "Here I am."
The angel said, "Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me."
Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
Abraham named that place Jehovah-Jireh, which means "The LORD will provide," as it is said to this day, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."
The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
saying, "By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,
and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."
So Abraham returned to his young men, and they set out together for Beersheba, where Abraham stayed.
After these events, Abraham was informed, "Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:
Huz, his firstborn, Buz, his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram,
as well as Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
His concubine, named Reumah, also bore children: Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
