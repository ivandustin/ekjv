Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.
The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
And the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
And the sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
And the sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan.
And the sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said, "Even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the LORD."
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city.
And Mizraim begat Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
And Pathrusim, Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
And the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
And the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite,
And the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward, the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you come to Gerar, unto Gaza; as you go, unto Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were children born.
The children of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
And the children of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
And Joktan begat Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
And Hadoram, Uzal, and Diklah,
And Obal, Abimael, and Sheba,
And Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go unto Sephar, a mount of the east.
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
