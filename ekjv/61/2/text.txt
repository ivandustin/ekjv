But there were false prophets also among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who secretly will introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
And many will follow their destructive ways; because of them, the way of truth will be maligned.
And through greed, they will exploit you with fabricated words: their judgment has long been hanging over them, and their destruction is not asleep.
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be held for judgment;
And did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, when He brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example for those who would afterward live ungodly;
And delivered just Lot, who was distressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked:
(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, tormented his righteous soul day after day by their unlawful deeds;)
The Lord knows how to deliver the godly from trials, and to reserve the unjust for the day of judgment to be punished:
But especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. Bold and self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries.
Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
But these, like natural brute beasts, made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand; and will utterly perish in their own corruption;
And will receive the reward of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, reveling in their own deceptions while they feast with you;
Having eyes full of adultery, and cannot cease from sin; enticing unstable souls: they have a heart trained in covetous practices; cursed children:
They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb donkey speaking with a man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet.
These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest; for whom the gloom of darkness is reserved forever.
For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, those who have actually escaped from those who live in error.
While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption: for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage.
For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning.
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to his own vomit, and a sow, having washed, returns to her wallowing in the mire.
