Every high priest taken from among men is appointed for the benefit of humanity in matters related to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
He can empathize with the ignorant and those who have strayed, since he himself is also surrounded by weaknesses.
For this reason, he must offer sacrifices for sins, both for the people and for himself.
No one assumes this honor on their own; it is given by God, just as it was given to Aaron.
Similarly, Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest; rather, it was He who said to Him, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you."
As it is stated in another passage, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
During His earthly life, He offered prayers and supplications with fervent cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission.
Although He was a Son, He learned obedience through the things He suffered.
And having been made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him,
designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
There are many things we could discuss about Him, but they are difficult to express because you have become dull of hearing.
By this time, you ought to be teachers, yet you still need someone to teach you the basic principles of God's word; you have become like those who need milk instead of solid food.
Anyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, for they are still an infant.
But solid food is for the mature, who by constant practice have trained their senses to distinguish good from evil.
