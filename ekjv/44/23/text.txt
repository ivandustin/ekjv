And Paul, earnestly gazing at the council, said, "Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
And the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.
Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet you command me to be struck contrary to the law?"
Those standing by asked, "Do you revile God's high priest?"
Then Paul replied, "I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.'"
But when Paul realized that one group was Sadducees and the other was Pharisees, he shouted in the council, "Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: I am being judged for the hope and resurrection of the dead."
And when he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge both.
And there was a great uproar; and the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and argued, saying, "We find no fault in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
And when a great dissension arose, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.
The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified for Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome."
And when day came, certain Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
More than forty men took part in this conspiracy.
They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves with a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
"Now therefore, you with the council inform the chief captain to bring him down to you tomorrow, as if you were going to inquire more thoroughly about him; and we are ready to kill him before he comes near."
When Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the castle and told Paul.
Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Bring this young man to the chief captain, for he has something to tell him."
So he took him and brought him to the chief captain, and said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you."
The chief captain took him by the hand, went aside privately, and asked him, "What is it you have to tell me?"
He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the council, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him.
But do not yield to them, for more than forty men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him; and now they are ready, looking for a promise from you."
So the chief captain let the young man depart and charged him, "See that you tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
He then called two centurions and said, "Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night;
And provide mounts for them, so they may set Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
He wrote a letter in this manner:
"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but I came with an army and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
When I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council.
I found he was accused concerning questions of their law, but had nothing charged against him deserving of death or imprisonment.
And when it was told to me that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him immediately to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you what they had against him. Farewell."
Then the soldiers, as commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
The next day, they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle.
When they arrived in Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul before him.
When the governor had read the letter, he asked what province Paul was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,
He said, "I will hear you when your accusers arrive." And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
