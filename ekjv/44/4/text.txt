As they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees approached them,
Being troubled that they were teaching the people and proclaiming through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
They seized them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.
However, many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.
The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes gathered together,
Including Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others from the high priest's family, in Jerusalem.
When they had placed them in the center, they asked, "By what power or by what name have you done this?"
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,
If we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to the disabled man, by what means he was made well;
Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, this man stands before you whole.
This is the stone that was rejected by you builders, which has become the cornerstone.
There is no salvation in any other name, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
When they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were astonished; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
And seeing the healed man standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.
But when they ordered them to leave the council, they conferred among themselves,
Saying, "What shall we do with these men? For a notable miracle has been performed through them, and it is evident to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
But to prevent it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."
So they called them and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John replied, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge.
For we cannot help but speak about what we have seen and heard."
After further threats, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.
For the man who had been healed was over forty years old.
After being released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
When they heard this, they raised their voices together to God and said, "Lord, you are God, who made heaven, earth, the sea, and everything in them:
Who by the mouth of your servant David said, 'Why did the nations rage, and the people plot in vain?'
The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers gathered together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.
Indeed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, conspired against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
To do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
And now, Lord, consider their threats, and grant your servants boldness to speak your word,
By stretching out your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
After they prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; none of them claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything in common.
With great power, the apostles gave testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
There was no one among them who lacked, for all who owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,
And laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each as any had need.
And Joses, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement"), a Levite from Cyprus,
Sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
