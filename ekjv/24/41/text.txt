In the seventh month, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of royal lineage, along with ten princes, approached Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, where they shared a meal together.
Then Ishmael, along with the ten men, rose up and struck Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing him; he had been appointed governor over the land by the king of Babylon.
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldeans found there and the soldiers.
On the second day after Gedaliah's death, when no one was aware of it,
Certain men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria—eighty men in total—having shaved beards, torn clothes, and self-inflicted wounds, bringing offerings and incense to present at the house of the LORD.
Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out to meet them, weeping as he approached, and when he met them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam."
As they entered the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, killed them and threw their bodies into a pit, along with the men who were with him.
However, ten men among them pleaded with Ishmael, saying, "Do not kill us, for we have treasures in the field: wheat, barley, oil, and honey." So he spared them and did not kill them with their brethren.
The pit where Ishmael cast the bodies of those he had slain because of Gedaliah was the same one that King Asa had made out of fear of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael filled it with the slain.
Ishmael then took captive all the remaining people in Mizpah, including the king's daughters and all those who had been entrusted to Gedaliah by Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, and he departed to go over to the Ammonites.
When Johanan, son of Kareah, and the captains of the forces with him heard of the atrocities committed by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah,
They gathered their men and went to confront Ishmael, finding him by the great waters in Gibeon.
When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan and the captains of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
All the captives that Ishmael had taken from Mizpah turned back and went to Johanan, son of Kareah.
But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, escaped from Johanan with eight men and fled to the Ammonites.
Then Johanan, son of Kareah, and the captains of the forces with him took all the remnant of the people they had recovered from Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, including mighty warriors, women, children, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
They departed and settled in the habitation of Chimham, near Bethlehem, intending to enter Egypt,
Because of the Chaldeans; they were afraid of them, as Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor in the land.
