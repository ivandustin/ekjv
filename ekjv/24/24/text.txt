The LORD showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had carried away captive Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with the princes of Judah, the carpenters, and the smiths, from Jerusalem to Babylon.
One basket contained very good figs, similar to the first ripe figs, while the other basket held very bad figs, which could not be eaten because they were so spoiled.
Then the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I replied, "Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad figs are very bad; they cannot be eaten because they are so spoiled."
Again, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Just as these good figs represent those who have been carried away captive from Judah, whom I have sent from this place to the land of the Chaldeans for their benefit.
For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD; they shall be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with their whole heart.
As for the bad figs, which cannot be eaten because they are so spoiled, the LORD says: So will I deal with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem that remain in this land, as well as those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
I will deliver them to be scattered among all the kingdoms of the earth for their harm, to become a reproach, a proverb, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I drive them.
I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence among them until they are consumed from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.
