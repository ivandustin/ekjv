The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the direction of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
You said, "Woe is me now! For the LORD has added grief to my sorrow; I have fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest."
Thus you shall say to him, "The LORD says this: Behold, that which I have built I will tear down, and that which I have planted I will uproot, even this entire land."
And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not; for behold, I will bring disaster upon all flesh, says the LORD; but I will give you your life as a prize in all the places where you go.
