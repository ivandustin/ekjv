The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpeh, declaring that none of them would give their daughters to the tribe of Benjamin as wives.
The people gathered at the house of God, remaining there until evening, lifting their voices and weeping bitterly before God.
They cried out, "O LORD God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, causing one tribe to be missing today?"
The next day, the people rose early, built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
The children of Israel asked, "Which tribe of Israel did not come up with the congregation to the LORD?" They had made a solemn oath regarding anyone who did not join them at Mizpeh, declaring, "He shall surely be put to death."
The children of Israel felt remorse for their brother Benjamin, saying, "Today, one tribe has been cut off from Israel."
They wondered how they could provide wives for those who remained, given that they had sworn to the LORD not to give their daughters to them as wives.
They inquired, "Which tribe of Israel did not come to Mizpeh to the LORD?" And indeed, no one from Jabeshgilead had joined the assembly.
The people were counted, and it was confirmed that none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead were present.
The congregation sent twelve thousand of their bravest men, commanding them, "Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead, including the women and children."
"This is what you shall do: utterly destroy every male and every woman who has known a man."
They discovered four hundred young virgins among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead, who had never been with a man, and brought them to the camp at Shiloh, in the land of Canaan.
The entire congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, calling out to them peacefully.
At that time, Benjamin returned, and they provided them with the wives they had saved alive from Jabeshgilead, but it was not enough for them.
The people felt remorse for Benjamin, realizing that the LORD had caused a division among the tribes of Israel.
Then the elders of the congregation said, "How can we provide wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?"
They stated, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe is not wiped out from Israel."
However, they could not give their daughters as wives, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, "Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin."
Then they said, "Look, there is an annual feast of the LORD in Shiloh, located on the north side of Bethel, east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards;
And watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance, then you may come out of the vineyards and each man catch a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and return to the land of Benjamin."
When their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we will say to them, "Be kind to them for our sake, for we did not provide each man with a wife in the war; you did not give them to them at this time, so you should not be guilty."
The children of Benjamin did as instructed, taking wives according to their number from those who danced, and they returned to their inheritance, rebuilding the cities and settling in them.
The children of Israel then departed, each man returning to his tribe and family, going out to his own inheritance.
In those days, there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
