And the men of Ephraim said to him, "Why have you treated us this way, not calling us when you went to fight the Midianites?" And they argued with him fiercely.
He replied, "What have I done now compared to you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the harvest of Abiezer?
God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what was I able to do compared to you?" Their anger toward him subsided when he said this.
Gideon crossed the Jordan, along with the three hundred men who were with him, weary but still pursuing.
He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
The princes of Succoth replied, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your possession, that we should give bread to your army?"
Gideon responded, "When the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
He then went up to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way; the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had.
He also told the men of Penuel, "When I return in peace, I will tear down this tower."
Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, along with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all that remained of the eastern armies; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew swords had fallen.
Gideon went by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he struck down the army, for it was secure.
When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, capturing the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he routed their entire army.
Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from battle before sunrise,
and caught a young man from Succoth, inquiring of him; he described to Gideon the princes of Succoth and their elders, seventy-seven men in total.
He went to the men of Succoth and said, "Look, Zebah and Zalmunna, whom you taunted me about, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your possession, that we should give bread to your weary men?'"
He took the elders of the city and taught the men of Succoth a lesson with thorns from the wilderness and briers.
He demolished the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" They answered, "They were like you; each one resembled the sons of a king."
He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you."
He then said to Jether, his firstborn, "Get up and kill them." But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, being still a youth.
Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and kill us, for as the man is, so is his strength." Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, taking the ornaments from their camels' necks.
The men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your son and your grandson, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
Gideon replied, "I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you."
Gideon then said to them, "I would like to make a request of you: give me every man the earrings of his plunder." (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
They answered, "We will willingly give them." They spread a garment and cast in every man the earrings of his plunder.
The weight of the golden earrings he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the ornaments, collars, and purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and the chains that were around their camels' necks.
Gideon made an ephod from this and placed it in his city, Ophrah; and all Israel went there to worship it, which became a snare to Gideon and his household.
Thus, Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they did not lift their heads again. The land had peace for forty years during the days of Gideon.
Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.
Gideon had seventy sons born to him, for he had many wives.
His concubine who lived in Shechem also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.
Gideon, the son of Joash, died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
As soon as Gideon died, the children of Israel turned again and worshiped the Baals, making Baalberith their god.
The children of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, for all the good he had done for Israel.
