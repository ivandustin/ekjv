After Abimelech, Tola, the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo, a man from the tribe of Issachar, arose to defend Israel. He resided in Shamir, located in the mountains of Ephraim.
He judged Israel for twenty-three years before he died and was buried in Shamir.
Following him, Jair, a Gileadite, emerged and judged Israel for twenty-two years.
Jair had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys, and they possessed thirty cities, known as Havothjair to this day, situated in the land of Gilead.
Jair passed away and was buried in Camon.
The children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, serving Baalim, Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, Zidon, Moab, the Ammonites, and the Philistines, forsaking the LORD and not serving Him.
The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites.
That year, they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years, affecting all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
Additionally, the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, causing great distress for Israel.
The children of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken our God and served Baalim."
The LORD responded to the children of Israel, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines?
The Zidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites also oppressed you, and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands.
Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore, I will no longer deliver you.
Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen; let them save you in your time of trouble."
The children of Israel replied to the LORD, "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to You; only deliver us this day, we pray."
They removed the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
Then the Ammonites gathered together and camped in Gilead, while the children of Israel assembled and camped in Mizpeh.
The people and leaders of Gilead said to one another, "Who is the man that will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be the head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
