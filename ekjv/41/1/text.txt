The opening of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you."
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying, "There comes one mightier than I after me, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
"I indeed have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you, I am well pleased."
And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.
He was in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,
And saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
When he had gone a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending their nets.
And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him.
They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and taught.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
In their synagogue, there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
"Saying, 'Let us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.'"
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him."
And when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him.
They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority, he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
And immediately his fame spread throughout all the region of Galilee.
And as soon as they came out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
But Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and they told him about her at once.
He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she served them.
That evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons, and he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
In the morning, rising very early before dawn, he went out and departed to a solitary place, and there he prayed.
Simon and those who were with him searched for him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
And he said to them, "Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came forth."
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out demons.
A leper came to him, beseeching him, kneeling down to him, and saying, "If you will, you can make me clean."
Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean."
As soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
And he strictly charged him and sent him away at once,
And said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
However, he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to him from every direction.
