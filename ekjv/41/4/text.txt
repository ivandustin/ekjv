And he began to teach again by the seaside; a great multitude gathered around him, so he entered a ship and sat in the sea, while the whole multitude was on the land by the sea.
He taught them many things in parables and said to them in his doctrine,
"Listen; behold, a sower went out to sow.
As he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.
Some fell on stony ground, where it had little earth; it sprang up immediately because it had no depth of soil.
But when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away.
Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, yielding no fruit.
Others fell on good ground, producing fruit that sprang up and increased; some yielded thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
He said to them, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parable.
He said to them, "To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables,
so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; lest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven."
He said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all parables?
The sower sows the word.
These are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground; when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy;
yet they have no root in themselves and endure only for a time. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word's sake, they are immediately offended.
These are the ones sown among thorns; they hear the word,
but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
These are the ones sown on good ground; they hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
He said to them, "Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?
For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
He said to them, "Take heed what you hear: with the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.
For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
He said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground;
and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.
For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.
But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."
He said, "To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?
It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown in the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;
but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade."
With many such parables, he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.
But without a parable, he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained all things to his disciples.
That same day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side."
When they had sent away the multitude, they took him along in the boat as he was. Other little boats were also with him.
A great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.
He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. They awoke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
He arose, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace, be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
He said to them, "Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?"
They feared exceedingly and said to one another, "What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
