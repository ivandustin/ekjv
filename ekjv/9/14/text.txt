One day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, spoke to the young man who carried his armor, saying, "Come, let us go to the Philistines' garrison on the other side." However, he did not inform his father.
Saul remained at the farthest part of Gibeah, under a pomegranate tree in Migron, with about six hundred men accompanying him.
Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, who was Ichabod's brother and the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, served as the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people were unaware that Jonathan had left.
Between the passages where Jonathan intended to cross to the Philistines' garrison, there were sharp rocks on either side: one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.
The front of one rock faced north toward Michmash, while the other faced south toward Gibeah.
Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come, let us go to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will act on our behalf, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."
His armor-bearer replied, "Do whatever you have in mind; I am with you, heart and soul."
Jonathan then said, "We will go over to these men and reveal ourselves to them."
If they say to us, "Wait until we come to you," we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
But if they say, "Come up to us," we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hands; this will be our sign.
Both of them revealed themselves to the Philistine garrison, and the Philistines said, "Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden."
The men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, saying, "Come up to us, and we will show you something." Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hands of Israel."
Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer following him. They fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed those who followed.
The first slaughter that Jonathan and his armor-bearer inflicted was about twenty men in an area that could be plowed by a yoke of oxen.
There was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked, resulting in a great panic.
The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was melting away, and they were beating down one another.
Saul then said to the people with him, "Count now and see who has left us." When they counted, they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
Saul said to Ahiah, "Bring the ark of God here." At that time, the ark of God was with the Israelites.
While Saul was talking to the priest, the noise in the Philistine camp increased, and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
Saul and all the people with him assembled and went to battle. Behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a great confusion.
Moreover, the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before this time, who had gone up with them into the camp from the surrounding countryside, also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
Likewise, all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hills of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines had fled, also pursued them in battle.
So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle moved on to Bethaven.
The men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had made the people swear, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, until I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.
All the people entered a forest, and there was honey on the ground.
When the people entered the forest, they saw that honey was dropping, but no one put their hand to their mouth, for they feared the oath.
However, Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people with the oath. So he put the end of the rod that was in his hand into the honeycomb and tasted it, and his eyes were enlightened.
Then one of the people answered, "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today.' And the people are faint."
Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. Look how my eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
How much better it would have been if the people had eaten freely today from the spoils of their enemies, for there would have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines!"
They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint.
The people rushed upon the spoil, taking sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; the people ate them with the blood.
Then they told Saul, "Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." He said, "You have acted treacherously; roll a large stone over here to me today."
Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and tell them, 'Bring me every man his ox and every man his sheep, and slaughter them here and eat; do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So all the people brought every man his ox that night and slaughtered them there.
Saul built an altar to the LORD; this was the first altar he built to the LORD.
Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until morning light; let us not leave a man of them." They replied, "Do whatever seems good to you." Then the priest said, "Let us draw near to God."
Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But God did not answer him that day.
Saul then said to all the leaders of the people, "Come here and let us find out what sin has been committed today.
As surely as the LORD lives, who rescues Israel, even if it is in Jonathan my son, he must die." But no one among the people said a word.
Then he said to all Israel, "You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." The people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
Therefore, Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, "Give a perfect lot." Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped.
Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." Jonathan was taken.
Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and now I must die."
Saul answered, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."
But the people said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the people rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they went back to their own territory.
So Saul took command of Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment.
He gathered an army and struck down the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishui, and Melchishua; the names of his two daughters were Merab, the firstborn, and Michal, the younger.
The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel.
There was fierce war against the Philistines throughout Saul's reign, and whenever Saul saw a strong or valiant man, he took him into his service.
