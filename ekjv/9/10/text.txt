Then Samuel took a vial of oil, poured it on his head, kissed him, and said, "Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over His inheritance?"
When you depart from me today, you will find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; they will say to you, "The donkeys you went to seek have been found, and your father has left the care of the donkeys and is worried about you, saying, 'What shall I do for my son?'"
Then you shall go on from there and come to the plain of Tabor, where you will meet three men going up to God at Bethel: one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.
They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hands.
After that, you shall come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is located. When you arrive at the city, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, a tabret, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy.
The Spirit of the LORD will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be transformed into another man.
And let it be that when these signs come to you, you do as the occasion demands, for God is with you.
You shall go down before me to Gilgal; behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you shall do.
It was so that when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs came to pass that day.
When they arrived at the hill, a company of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
When all who knew him before saw that he prophesied among the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
One of the bystanders answered, "But who is their father?" Therefore, it became a proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
Saul's uncle said to him and his servant, "Where did you go?" He replied, "To seek the donkeys; and when we saw they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel."
Saul's uncle said, "Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you."
Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But regarding the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him."
Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpeh.
He said to the children of Israel, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: I brought Israel up out of Egypt and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all kingdoms that oppressed you.
And today you have rejected your God, who saved you from all your adversities and tribulations; and you have said to Him, 'No, but set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands."
When Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
Therefore, they inquired of the LORD further if the man should yet come there. The LORD answered, "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
They ran and fetched him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "God save the king!"
Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his house.
Saul also went home to Gibeah, and a band of men whose hearts God had touched went with him.
But the children of Belial said, "How can this man save us?" They despised him and brought him no presents, but he held his peace.
