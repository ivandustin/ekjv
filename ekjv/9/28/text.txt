And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines assembled their armies for battle against Israel. Achish said to David, "Know for certain that you and your men will go out with me to fight."
David replied to Achish, "Surely you know what your servant can do." Achish responded, "Therefore, I will make you my permanent bodyguard."
Now Samuel was dead, and all of Israel mourned for him, burying him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had removed those with familiar spirits and wizards from the land.
The Philistines gathered and camped at Shunem, while Saul assembled all of Israel and pitched his camp at Gilboa.
When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him, neither through dreams, Urim, nor prophets.
Then Saul said to his servants, "Find me a woman who has a familiar spirit so I can go to her and inquire of her." His servants replied, "There is a woman with a familiar spirit at Endor."
Saul disguised himself, changed his clothes, and went with two men to the woman at night. He said, "Please consult the spirit for me and bring up the one I name."
The woman replied, "You know what Saul has done: he has cut off those with familiar spirits and wizards from the land. Why then do you set a trap for my life to cause me to die?"
Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, "As the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."
The woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He answered, "Bring me up Samuel."
When the woman saw Samuel, she let out a loud scream and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
The king said to her, "Do not be afraid. What do you see?" The woman replied, "I see gods ascending from the earth."
He asked her, "What does he look like?" She said, "An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a mantle." Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground.
Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I am in great distress; the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me and answers me no more, neither by prophets nor dreams. Therefore, I have called you to tell me what I should do."
Samuel replied, "Why do you ask me, since the LORD has departed from you and has become your enemy?"
The LORD has done to you as He spoke through me: He has torn the kingdom from your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today.
Furthermore, the LORD will deliver Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines.
Immediately, Saul fell to the ground, terrified by Samuel's words, and he had no strength left in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and night.
The woman approached Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled. She said, "Your servant has obeyed your voice; I put my life in my hands and listened to your words."
"Now, please listen to your servant's voice and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, so you may have strength for your journey."
But he refused, saying, "I will not eat." However, his servants and the woman urged him, and he listened to their voice. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
The woman had a fat calf in her house; she hurried, killed it, took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
