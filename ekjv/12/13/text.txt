In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for seventeen years.
He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which caused Israel to sin; he did not turn away from them.
The anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael, king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, throughout their days.
Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD, and the LORD listened to him, for He saw the oppression of Israel, as the king of Syria oppressed them.
(The LORD provided Israel with a savior, so they escaped from the hand of the Syrians; the children of Israel returned to their tents, as they had done before.
Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin, but continued in them; and the Asherah pole remained in Samaria.)
He left Jehoahaz with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, making them as dust in the threshing.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
Jehoahaz slept with his ancestors, and he was buried in Samaria; his son Joash reigned in his place.
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for sixteen years.
He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin; he continued in them.
The rest of the acts of Joash, all that he did, and his might in fighting against Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
Joash slept with his ancestors, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
Now Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he died. Joash, the king of Israel, came down to him, weeping over his face, and said, "O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!"
Elisha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows." So he took a bow and arrows.
He said to the king of Israel, "Put your hand upon the bow." He put his hand upon it, and Elisha placed his hands upon the king's hands.
He said, "Open the window eastward." And he opened it. Then Elisha said, "Shoot." And he shot. He said, "The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek until you have consumed them."
He said, "Take the arrows." And he took them. Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground." He struck it three times and stopped.
The man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it. But now you shall strike Syria only three times."
Elisha died, and they buried him. The bands of Moabites invaded the land at the beginning of the year.
As they were burying a man, they spied a band of men; they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha, and when the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.
But Hazael, king of Syria, oppressed Israel throughout the days of Jehoahaz.
The LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and regarded them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He would not destroy them or cast them from His presence as yet.
So Hazael, king of Syria, died, and his son Benhadad reigned in his place.
Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, recovered from Benhadad, the son of Hazael, the cities that he had taken from Jehoahaz, his father, by war. Joash defeated him three times and recovered the cities of Israel.
