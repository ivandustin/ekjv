Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman who is cherished by her friend, yet is unfaithful, reflecting the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who turn to other gods and delight in wine."
So I purchased her for fifteen pieces of silver, along with a homer and a half of barley.
And I told her, "You must remain with me for many days; you shall not engage in prostitution, nor belong to another man; in the same way, I will be devoted to you."
For the children of Israel will remain many days without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without an idol, without an ephod, and without teraphim.
Afterward, the children of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; they will fear the LORD and His goodness in the latter days.
