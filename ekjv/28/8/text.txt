Sound the trumpet to your lips. He will come like an eagle against the house of the LORD, for they have violated my covenant and transgressed my law.
Israel will cry out to me, "My God, we acknowledge you."
Israel has rejected what is good; the enemy will pursue him.
They have appointed kings, but not by my authority; they have made princes, and I was unaware of it. With their silver and gold, they have created idols, leading to their destruction.
Your calf, O Samaria, has rejected you; my anger is ignited against them: how long will it be until they achieve innocence?
For it originated from Israel: the craftsman made it; thus, it is not God. The calf of Samaria will be shattered into pieces.
They have sown the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind: it has no stalk; the bud will yield no grain. If it does yield, strangers will consume it.
Israel is consumed: now they will be among the Gentiles like a vessel that brings no delight.
For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey alone: Ephraim has sought out lovers.
Yes, even though they have sought help from the nations, I will gather them, and they will grieve briefly for the burden of the king of princes.
Because Ephraim has built many altars for sin, those altars will become a source of sin for him.
I have written to him the significant aspects of my law, but they were regarded as something foreign.
They sacrifice flesh for the offerings I have provided and consume it; however, the LORD does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: they will return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built temples; Judah has increased fortified cities. But I will send fire upon his cities, and it will consume their palaces.
