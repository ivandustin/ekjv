Then Darius the king issued a decree, and a search was conducted in the archives where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace located in the province of the Medes, a scroll, which contained a record written as follows:
In the first year of King Cyrus, the same Cyrus issued a decree regarding the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices are offered, and let its foundations be firmly established; its height shall be sixty cubits, and its width shall be sixty cubits;
With three rows of large stones and a row of new timber; and let the expenses be provided from the king's treasury.
Additionally, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its designated place, and placed in the house of God.
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, stay away from there.
Let the work on this house of God be left alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God in its designated place.
Moreover, I issue a decree regarding what you shall do to the elders of these Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God: that from the king's goods, even from the tribute beyond the river, immediate expenses be provided to these men, so that they are not hindered.
And whatever they require, including young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the specifications of the priests in Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail.
So that they may offer sweet-smelling sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Furthermore, I have issued a decree that whoever alters this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap for this.
And may the God who has caused His name to dwell there destroy all kings and peoples who attempt to alter or destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued a decree; let it be carried out promptly.
Then Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, acted quickly in accordance with what King Darius had sent.
And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and completed it, according to the command of the God of Israel, and in accordance with the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia.
And this house was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
And the children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
And at the dedication of this house of God, they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel.
And they appointed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
And the children of the exiles celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean, and they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the children of the exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
And the children of Israel who had returned from exile, along with all who had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of the land to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate.
And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
