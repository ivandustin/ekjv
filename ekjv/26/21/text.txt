And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and direct your words toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel.
And say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw my sword out of its sheath, and I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
Since I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go forth from its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north.
So that all flesh may know that I, the LORD, have drawn my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.
Sigh, therefore, son of man, with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness, sigh before their eyes.
And it shall be, when they say to you, 'Why do you sigh?' that you shall answer, 'Because of the tidings; for it is coming: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it is coming, and shall be brought to pass,' says the Lord GOD.
Again, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"Son of man, prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the LORD: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.
It is sharpened to make a great slaughter; it is polished so that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? It despises the rod of my son, as every tree.
And He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened and polished, to be given into the hand of the slayer.
Cry and wail, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors because of the sword shall be upon my people: therefore, strike your thigh.
Because it is a trial, and what if the sword despises even the rod? It shall be no more, says the Lord GOD.
You, therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together. Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their private chambers.
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, so that their hearts may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for slaughter.
Go one way or the other, either to the right or to the left, wherever your face is set.
I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I, the LORD, have said it.
The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
"Also, son of man, appoint two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and choose a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
Appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem, the fortified.
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked at the liver.
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mound, and to build a fort.
And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, to those who have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance their iniquity, that they may be taken.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because I say that you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken by the hand.
And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, when iniquity shall have an end,
Thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him who is low, and abase him who is high.
I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it to him.
And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; say, "The sword, the sword is drawn: for slaughter it is polished, to consume because of the glittering."
While they see vanity unto you, while they divine a lie unto you, to bring you upon the necks of those who are slain, of the wicked, whose day has come, when their iniquity shall have an end.
Shall I cause it to return to its sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your nativity.
And I will pour out my indignation upon you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skilled in destruction.
You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I, the LORD, have spoken it."
