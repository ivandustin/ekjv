Give unto the LORD, O mighty ones, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
Give unto the LORD the glory that is due to His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is over many waters.
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; indeed, the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and uncovers the forests; in His temple, all cry, "Glory!"
The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; indeed, the LORD sits as King forever.
The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.
