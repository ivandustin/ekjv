O God, you have cast us off; you have scattered us; you have shown displeasure. Please turn back to us once more.
You have made the earth tremble; you have broken it. Heal its breaches, for it is shaking.
You have shown your people difficult things; you have made us drink the wine of astonishment.
You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed in the name of truth. Selah.
That your beloved may be delivered; save us with your right hand, and hear my plea.
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver.
Moab is my washpot; over Edom I will cast my shoe; Philistia, rejoice because of me.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Will you not, O God, who has cast us off? Will you not, O God, who did not go out with our armies?
Give us help in our trouble, for the help of man is worthless.
Through God, we shall act valiantly, for it is he who will trample down our enemies.
