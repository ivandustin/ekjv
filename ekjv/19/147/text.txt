Praise the LORD, for it is good to sing praises to our God; it is pleasant, and praise is beautiful.
The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name.
Great is our Lord, and His power is immense; His understanding is beyond measure.
The LORD lifts up the humble; He casts the wicked down to the ground.
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; play praises on the harp to our God.
He covers the heavens with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, and makes grass grow on the mountains.
He provides food for the animals and for the young ravens that cry out.
He does not take pleasure in the strength of the horse; He does not delight in the legs of a man.
The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear Him, in those who hope in His mercy.
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you.
He makes peace within your borders and fills you with the finest wheat.
He sends forth His command on earth; His word runs swiftly.
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes.
He casts forth His ice like crumbs; who can withstand His cold?
He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He shows His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.
He has not dealt so with any nation; as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the LORD.
