Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all you lands.
Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing.
Know that the LORD, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name.
For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures through all generations.
