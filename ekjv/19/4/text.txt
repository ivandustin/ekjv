Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; you have enlarged me in my distress. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
O sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.
But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD will hear me when I call to Him.
Stand in awe and sin not; commune with your own heart on your bed and be still. Selah.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the LORD.
There are many who say, "Who will show us any good?" LORD, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.
You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and wine abound.
I will both lie down in peace and sleep, for You, LORD, alone make me dwell in safety.
