Lord, You have been our refuge throughout all generations.
Before the mountains were formed, or the earth and the world were created, from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.
You turn humanity to destruction, and say, "Return, O children of men."
For a thousand years in Your sight are like yesterday when it has passed, and like a watch in the night.
You carry them away like a flood; they are like a dream: in the morning they are like grass that grows.
In the morning it flourishes and grows; in the evening it is cut down and withers.
For we are consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath we are troubled.
You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.
For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we spend our years as a story that is told.
The days of our years are seventy; and if by reason of strength they reach eighty, yet their strength is labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of Your anger? According to Your fear, so is Your wrath.
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.
Return, O LORD, how long? And have compassion on Your servants.
O satisfy us early with Your mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days You have afflicted us, and the years we have seen trouble.
Let Your work be shown to Your servants, and Your glory to their children.
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us; establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, the work of our hands establish it.
