I will sing of the LORD's mercies forever; with my mouth, I will proclaim your faithfulness to all generations.
For I have declared, Mercy will be established forever; your faithfulness you will set in the heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David, my servant.
Your descendants I will establish forever, and I will build up your throne for all generations. Selah.
The heavens will praise your wonders, O LORD; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints.
For who in heaven can be compared to the LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and revered by all who surround him.
O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like you? Or your faithfulness that surrounds you?
You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.
You have shattered Rahab like one who is slain; you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all its fullness, you have founded them.
The north and the south, you created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.
Justice and judgment are the foundation of your throne; mercy and truth go before your face.
Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound; they walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance.
In your name, they rejoice all day long; and in your righteousness, they are exalted.
For you are the glory of their strength; and in your favor, our horn will be exalted.
For the LORD is our defense; the Holy One of Israel is our king.
Then you spoke in a vision to your holy one, saying, I have laid help upon one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil, I have anointed him.
With whom my hand will be established; my arm will also strengthen him.
The enemy will not exact upon him; nor will the son of wickedness afflict him.
And I will crush his foes before him and plague those who hate him.
But my faithfulness and my mercy will be with him; and in my name, his horn will be exalted.
I will set his hand over the sea and his right hand over the rivers.
He will cry to me, You are my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
I will also make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm with him.
His descendants I will make endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
If his children forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments;
If they break my statutes and do not keep my commandments;
Then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.
Nevertheless, my lovingkindness I will not utterly take from him, nor will I let my faithfulness fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter what has gone out of my lips.
Once I have sworn by my holiness that I will not lie to David.
His descendants will endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.
It will be established forever like the moon, a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
But you have cast off and rejected; you have been angry with your anointed one.
You have made void the covenant of your servant; you have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
You have broken down all his walls; you have brought his strongholds to ruin.
All who pass by the way plunder him; he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
You have also turned the edge of his sword and have not allowed him to stand in battle.
You have made his glory cease and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth you have shortened; you have covered him with shame. Selah.
How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?
Remember how short my time is; why have you made all men in vain?
What man is there who lives and will not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
Lord, where are your former lovingkindnesses, which you swore to David in your truth?
Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants; how I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
With which your enemies have reproached, O LORD; with which they have reproached the footsteps of your anointed.
Blessed be the LORD forevermore. Amen and Amen.
