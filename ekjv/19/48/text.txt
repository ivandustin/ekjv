Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, on the mountain of His holiness.
Beautiful in its elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, located on the northern slopes, the city of the great King.
God is known in her palaces as a refuge.
For behold, the kings were assembled; they passed by together.
They saw it and marveled; they were troubled and hurried away.
Fear seized them there, and pain, like that of a woman in labor.
You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah.
We have reflected on Your lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.
Let Mount Zion rejoice; let the daughters of Judah be glad because of Your judgments.
Walk around Zion and go all around her; tell of her towers.
Pay close attention to her bulwarks; consider her palaces, so that you may tell it to the next generation.
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even unto death.
