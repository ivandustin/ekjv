Why do you stand far off, O LORD? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
The wicked, in his pride, persecutes the poor; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire and blesses the greedy, whom the LORD detests.
The wicked, through the pride of his appearance, does not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.
His ways are always troubling; your judgments are far above his sight; as for all his enemies, he scoffs at them.
He has said in his heart, "I shall not be shaken; I will never face adversity."
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; under his tongue lie mischief and vanity.
He sits in the hidden places of the villages; in secret spots, he murders the innocent; his eyes are secretly set against the poor.
He lies in wait like a lion in his den; he waits to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws them into his net.
He crouches and humbles himself, so the poor may fall by his strong ones.
He has said in his heart, "God has forgotten; he hides his face; he will never see it."
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the humble.
Why does the wicked despise God? He has said in his heart, "You will not require it."
You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to repay it with your hand; the poor commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man; seek out his wickedness until you find none.
The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from his land.
LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble; you will prepare their heart; you will cause your ear to hear:
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the earth may no longer oppress.
