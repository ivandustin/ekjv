After these events, Jesus crossed over the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
A large crowd followed him because they witnessed the miracles he performed on those who were ill.
Jesus went up a mountain and sat down with his disciples.
The Passover, a Jewish feast, was approaching.
When Jesus lifted his eyes and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"
He said this to test him, for he already knew what he intended to do.
Philip replied, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, for each one would only receive a little."
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?"
Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, numbering about five thousand.
Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those seated; he did the same with the fish, giving as much as they wanted.
When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, "Gather the leftover pieces so that nothing is wasted."
So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the fragments from the five barley loaves that were left over after everyone had eaten.
When the people saw the miracle that Jesus performed, they said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."
When Jesus realized that they intended to come and make him king by force, he withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
got into a boat, and set off across the sea toward Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
A strong wind began to blow, and the sea grew rough.
After they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.
But he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."
Then they willingly took him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples but had left them alone.
However, other boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
When the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum, searching for Jesus.
When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him, God the Father has set his seal."
Then they asked him, "What must we do to be doing the works of God?"
Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
So they said to him, "What sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform?
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
They said to him, "Sir, give us this bread always."
Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.
All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.
For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.
And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.
And this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."
The Jews then grumbled about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"
Jesus answered them, "Do not grumble among yourselves.
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.
It is written in the Prophets, 'And they will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.
Not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.
I am that bread of life.
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.
I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever, and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me.
This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever."
Jesus said these things in the synagogue as he taught at Capernaum.
Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"
But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, "Do you take offense at this?
Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.
And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father."
After this, many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.
So Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you want to go away as well?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,
and we have believed, and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil."
He was speaking of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.
