For this reason, I, Paul, am a prisoner of Jesus Christ for the sake of you Gentiles.
If you have heard about the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you,
How that by revelation He made known to me the mystery; (as I previously wrote briefly,
So that when you read it, you may understand my insight into the mystery of Christ)
Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
That the Gentiles are to be fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel;
Of which I became a minister, according to the gift of God's grace given to me through the effective working of His power.
To me, who am less than the least of all saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
And to make all people see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;
To the intent that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places,
According to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord;
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him.
Therefore, I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
From whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,
That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man;
That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
May be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width, and length, and depth, and height;
And to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
To Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
