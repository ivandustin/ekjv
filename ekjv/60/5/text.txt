I exhort the elders among you, as I am also an elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings, and a participant in the glory that will be revealed.
Shepherd the flock of God that is in your care, overseeing them not out of obligation, but willingly; not for dishonest gain, but with a ready mind.
Do not act as lords over God's heritage, but be examples to the flock.
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of glory that will never fade away.
Similarly, you younger ones, submit yourselves to the elders. Yes, all of you should be subject to one another and be clothed with humility, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time.
Cast all your anxieties on Him, for He cares for you.
Be sober and vigilant, because your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
Resist him, standing firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being experienced by your fellow believers throughout the world.
But the God of all grace, who has called us to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered for a little while, will perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Through Silvanus, a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends greetings; and so does my son Marcus.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
