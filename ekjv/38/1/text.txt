In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
The LORD has been greatly displeased with your ancestors.
Therefore, say to them, Thus says the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets cried out, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts: Turn now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds; yet they did not listen or pay attention to me, says the LORD.
Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your ancestors? They returned and said, Just as the LORD of hosts intended to do to us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so has He dealt with us.
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Sebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
I saw at night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees in the valley; and behind him were red, speckled, and white horses.
Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.
And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
And they answered the angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, saying, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and quiet.
Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?
And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me with good and comforting words.
So the angel who spoke with me said to me, Proclaim, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy.
And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was only a little displeased, and they helped to advance the affliction.
Therefore, thus says the LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts, and a measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
Proclaim further, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.
Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns.
And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Then I said, What are these coming to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, so that no one could lift up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
