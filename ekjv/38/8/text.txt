Once more, the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am deeply jealous for Zion, with great zeal; I am fiercely protective of her.
Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the heart of Jerusalem; Jerusalem will be called the city of truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women will yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with their staff in hand because of their age.
The streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in them.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: If this seems marvelous to the remnant of this people in these days, should it also seem marvelous to me? says the LORD of hosts.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east and from the west;
I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and righteousness.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear these words from the prophets, which were spoken on the day the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, so that the temple might be built.
For before these days, there was no wage for man or beast; there was no peace for anyone who went out or came in because of the affliction, for I set everyone against their neighbor.
But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did in former days, says the LORD of hosts.
For the seed will be prosperous; the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
And it will come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing; do not fear, but let your hands be strong.
For thus says the LORD of hosts: As I intended to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says the LORD of hosts, and I did not relent:
So I have now intended in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; do not fear.
These are the things you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render true and peaceful judgments in your gates.
And let none of you devise evil in your hearts against your neighbor; and do not love false oaths, for all these are things that I hate, says the LORD.
And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will be turned into joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; therefore, love truth and peace.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: It will yet come to pass that people will come, and the inhabitants of many cities will gather;
And the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, "Let us go quickly to pray before the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will go with you."
Indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to pray before the LORD.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days, it will come to pass that ten men from all languages of the nations will take hold of the hem of a Jew's garment, saying, "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."
