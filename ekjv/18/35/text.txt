Elihu spoke further and said,
Do you think it is right to claim, "My righteousness exceeds that of God"?
For you asked, "What benefit is it to you? What gain will I have if I am cleansed from my sin?"
I will respond to you and your companions.
Look to the heavens and observe; behold the clouds that are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you do against Him? And if your transgressions increase, what do you do to Him?
If you are righteous, what do you give Him? What does He receive from your hand?
Your wickedness may harm a fellow human; your righteousness may benefit a son of man.
Due to the multitude of oppressions, the oppressed cry out; they call out because of the might of the powerful.
Yet none asks, "Where is God my Creator, who gives songs in the night?"
Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?
They cry out, but no one answers, due to the arrogance of wicked men.
Surely God will not listen to emptiness, nor will the Almighty pay attention to it.
Even if you say you cannot see Him, judgment is before Him; therefore, trust in Him.
But now, because it is not so, He has acted in His anger; yet they do not recognize it in their great distress.
Thus, Job speaks without purpose; he multiplies words without understanding.
