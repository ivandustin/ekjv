Moreover, the LORD answered Job and said,
"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty instruct Him? The one who reproves God, let him respond."
Then Job answered the LORD and said,
"Behold, I am vile; what shall I say to You? I will place my hand over my mouth."
"Once I have spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further."
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
"Prepare yourself like a man: I will question you, and you shall answer Me."
"Will you also disannul My judgment? Will you condemn Me so that you may be righteous?"
"Do you have an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like Him?"
"Adorn yourself now with majesty and splendor; and array yourself with glory and beauty."
"Unleash the fury of your wrath: and look at everyone who is proud, and humble him."
"Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place."
"Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret."
"Then I will also confess to you that your own right hand can save you."
"Behold now behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox."
"Look now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in the muscles of his belly."
"He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit."
"His bones are like strong pieces of bronze; his limbs are like bars of iron."
"He is the chief of the ways of God; he who made him can make his sword approach him."
"Surely the mountains bring him food, where all the beasts of the field play."
"He lies under the shady trees, in the cover of the reeds and marsh."
"The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows by the brook surround him."
"Behold, he drinks up a river and is not in haste; he trusts that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth."
"He takes it in with his eyes; his nose pierces through snares."
