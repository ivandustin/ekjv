I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a young woman?
For what portion of God is there from above? And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Is not destruction reserved for the wicked? And is there not a strange punishment for the workers of iniquity?
Does He not see my ways and count all my steps?
If I have walked in vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit;
Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity.
If my steps have strayed from the path, and my heart followed my eyes, and if any stain has clung to my hands;
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be uprooted.
If my heart has been deceived by a woman, or if I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;
Then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her.
For this is a heinous crime; yes, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
For it is a fire that consumes to destruction and would root out all my increase.
If I have despised the cause of my servant or maidservant when they contended with me;
What then shall I do when God rises up? And when He visits, what shall I answer Him?
Did not He who made me in the womb make them? And did not one fashion us in the womb?
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;
(For from my youth, he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
If I have seen any perish for lack of clothing, or any poor without covering;
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw my help in the gate:
Then let my arm fall from my shoulder blade, and let my arm be broken from the bone.
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of His majesty, I could not endure.
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to fine gold, "You are my confidence;"
If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much;
If I beheld the sun when it shone, or the moon walking in brightness;
And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:
This also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judge; for I would have denied the God who is above.
If I rejoice at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted myself up when evil found him:
Neither have I allowed my mouth to sin by wishing a curse upon his soul.
If the men of my tent did not say, "Oh, that we had of his flesh! We cannot be satisfied."
The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveler.
If I covered my transgressions like Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence and did not go out of the door?
Oh, that someone would hear me! Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book.
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me.
I would declare to Him the number of my steps; as a prince, I would go near to Him.
If my land cries out against me, or if its furrows likewise complain;
If I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their lives:
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
