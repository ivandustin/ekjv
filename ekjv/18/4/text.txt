Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded and said,
"If we attempt to speak with you, will you be upset? But who can refrain from speaking?"
"Look, you have taught many, and you have strengthened the weak."
"Your words have supported those who were falling, and you have bolstered the feeble."
"But now that it has come upon you, you are faint; it touches you, and you are troubled."
"Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the integrity of your ways?"
"Remember, I ask you, who has ever perished being innocent? Or where have the righteous been cut off?"
"Just as I have observed, those who cultivate iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same."
"By the breath of God, they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils, they are consumed."
"The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken."
"The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the strong lion's cubs are scattered."
"Now a matter was secretly brought to me, and my ear caught a whisper of it."
"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,"
"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake."
"Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair on my flesh stood up."
"It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice saying,"
"Can mortal man be more just than God? Can a man be purer than his Maker?"
"Look, He puts no trust in His servants; and He charges His angels with error."
"How much less in those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?"
"They are destroyed from morning to evening; they perish forever without anyone noticing."
"Does not their splendor fade away? They die, even without wisdom."
