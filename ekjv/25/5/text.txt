Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us; consider and behold our reproach.
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to aliens.
We are orphans and fatherless; our mothers are like widows.
We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold to us.
Our necks are under persecution; we labor and find no rest.
We have extended our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers have sinned and are no more; we bear their iniquities.
Servants rule over us; there is no one who delivers us from their hand.
We obtain our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.
Our skin has become as black as an oven due to the terrible famine.
They have ravished the women in Zion and the maidens in the cities of Judah.
Princes are hanged by their hands; the faces of the elders are not honored.
They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
The elders have ceased from the gate, and the young men from their music.
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance has turned into mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!
For this, our heart is faint; for these things, our eyes are dim.
Because of the desolation of Mount Zion, the foxes walk upon it.
You, O LORD, remain forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.
Why do you forget us forever and forsake us for such a long time?
Restore us to yourself, O LORD, and we shall be restored; renew our days as of old.
But you have utterly rejected us; you are very angry with us.
