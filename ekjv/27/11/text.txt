I stood to confirm and strengthen him in the first year of Darius the Mede.
Now I will reveal the truth to you. Behold, there will arise three more kings in Persia, and the fourth will be far richer than all of them; by his strength through his riches, he will incite all against the realm of Greece.
A mighty king will arise, who will rule with great dominion and act according to his will.
When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven; it will not go to his descendants, nor according to the dominion he ruled, for his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others.
The king of the south will be strong, along with one of his princes; he will be stronger than him and will have dominion; his dominion will be great.
In the end of years, they will join forces; the king's daughter of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain the power of her position; neither will he stand, nor his power: she will be given up, along with those who brought her, her father, and those who supported her during these times.
But from a branch of her roots, one will arise in his place, who will come with an army, enter the fortress of the king of the north, and prevail against them.
He will also carry captives into Egypt, along with their gods, their princes, and their precious vessels of silver and gold; he will continue longer than the king of the north.
The king of the south will enter his kingdom and return to his own land.
But his sons will be stirred up and will assemble a great multitude of forces; one will certainly come, overflow, and pass through; then he will return and be stirred up to his fortress.
The king of the south will be enraged and will come out to fight against the king of the north; he will set forth a great multitude, but the multitude will be given into his hand.
When he has taken away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cast down many thousands, but he will not be strengthened by it.
The king of the north will return and will set forth a multitude greater than the former; he will certainly come after a few years with a great army and much wealth.
In those times, many will stand up against the king of the south; also, the robbers of your people will exalt themselves to fulfill the vision, but they will fall.
The king of the north will come, build a siege mound, and take the most fortified cities; the forces of the south will not withstand, nor will his chosen people, and there will be no strength to resist.
He who comes against him will act according to his own will, and none will stand before him; he will stand in the glorious land, which will be consumed by his hand.
He will set his face to enter with the strength of his entire kingdom, and upright ones will be with him; thus he will act: he will give him the daughter of women, corrupting her, but she will not stand by his side or be for him.
After this, he will turn his face toward the isles and will take many; but a prince for his own behalf will cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach, he will turn it upon himself.
Then he will turn his face toward the fortress of his own land, but he will stumble and fall, and will not be found.
Then a raiser of taxes will stand in his place in the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days, he will be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle.
In his place, a vile person will arise, to whom they will not give the honor of the kingdom; he will come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
With the arms of a flood, they will be overwhelmed before him and will be broken; yes, even the prince of the covenant.
After the league made with him, he will act deceitfully; for he will rise up and become strong with a small people.
He will enter peaceably even upon the richest areas of the province; he will do what his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers; he will distribute among them the prey, spoil, and riches; yes, he will devise plans against the strongholds for a time.
He will stir up his power and courage against the king of the south with a great army; the king of the south will be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army, but he will not stand, for they will devise plans against him.
Yes, those who feed on his portion will destroy him, and his army will overflow; many will fall down slain.
Both kings' hearts will be set on mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it will not prosper, for the end will come at the appointed time.
Then he will return to his land with great riches; his heart will be against the holy covenant, and he will act with great exploits, returning to his own land.
At the appointed time, he will return and come toward the south, but it will not be as the former or the latter.
For the ships of Chittim will come against him; therefore, he will be grieved and return, having indignation against the holy covenant; so he will act; he will even return and have intelligence with those who forsake the holy covenant.
Arms will stand on his part, and they will pollute the sanctuary of strength, take away the daily sacrifice, and place the abomination that makes desolate.
Those who act wickedly against the covenant he will corrupt with flatteries; but the people who know their God will be strong and do exploits.
Those who understand among the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword, by flame, by captivity, and by spoil for many days.
When they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will cling to them with flatteries.
Some of those with understanding will fall, to test them, to purify them, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for an appointed time.
The king will act according to his will; he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and will prosper until the indignation is accomplished, for what is determined will be done.
He will neither regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor any god; for he will magnify himself above all.
In his place, he will honor the god of fortresses; a god whom his fathers did not know, he will honor with gold, silver, precious stones, and pleasant things.
Thus he will act in the strongest fortresses with a strange god, whom he will acknowledge and increase with glory; he will cause them to rule over many and will divide the land for gain.
At the time of the end, the king of the south will push against him; the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, horsemen, and many ships; he will enter the countries and overflow and pass over.
He will also enter the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown; but these will escape from his hand, even Edom, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
He will stretch forth his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.
He will have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; the Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow at his heels.
But tidings from the east and the north will trouble him; therefore, he will go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly make away many.
He will plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
