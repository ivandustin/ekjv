And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said, "There were two men in one city; one was rich, and the other was poor.
The rich man had an abundance of flocks and herds.
But the poor man had nothing except for one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised; it grew up with him and his children. It ate from his plate, drank from his cup, and lay in his bosom; it was like a daughter to him.
Then a traveler came to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take from his own flock or herd to prepare a meal for the wayfaring man who had come to him; instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.
David's anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this shall surely die!
He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no pity."
Nathan said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your bosom, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have given you even more.
Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and taken his wife to be your wife, and you have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun."
David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has also put away your sin; you shall not die.
However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child born to you shall surely die."
Nathan then departed to his house. The LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it became very sick.
David therefore pleaded with God for the child; he fasted, went in, and lay all night on the ground.
The elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat bread with them.
On the seventh day, the child died. David's servants feared to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "While the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our voice; how can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do something desperate."
But when David saw that his servants whispered, he perceived that the child was dead. Therefore, David asked his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."
Then David arose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, went into the house of the LORD, and worshiped. Afterward, he came to his own house, and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate.
His servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate bread."
He said, "While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who can tell whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'
But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. She bore a son, and he named him Solomon; the LORD loved him.
He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah because of the LORD.
Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon and took the royal city.
Joab sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and taken the city of waters.
Now, therefore, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name."
David gathered all the people together, went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it.
He took the king's crown from his head; its weight was a talent of gold with precious stones, and it was set on David's head. He brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance.
He brought out the people who were in it and put them under saws, under iron harrows, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln. Thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
