And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to Aaron and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall shine in front of the candlestick.'"
And Aaron did as commanded; he lit the lamps in front of the candlestick, as the LORD instructed Moses.
The candlestick was made of beaten gold, including its shaft and flowers, crafted according to the pattern shown to Moses by the LORD.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and purify them."
"This is how you shall purify them: Sprinkle the water of purification on them, have them shave all their body hair, and wash their clothes to make themselves clean."
"Then they shall take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and another young bull shall be taken for a sin offering."
"You shall present the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and gather the entire assembly of the children of Israel."
"You shall present the Levites before the LORD, and the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites."
"And Aaron shall present the Levites before the LORD as an offering from the children of Israel, so they may perform the service of the LORD."
"The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites."
"You shall present the Levites before Aaron and his sons and offer them as an offering to the LORD."
"This is how you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; the Levites shall be mine."
"After this, the Levites shall enter to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; you shall purify them and offer them as an offering."
"For they are entirely dedicated to me from among the children of Israel; instead of every firstborn that opens the womb, I have taken them for myself."
"All the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast; on the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself."
"I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the children of Israel."
"I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel, to perform the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that no plague will come upon the children of Israel when they approach the sanctuary."
And Moses, Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites according to all that the LORD commanded Moses; so the children of Israel did to them.
The Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; Aaron presented them as an offering before the LORD and made atonement for them to cleanse them.
After this, the Levites entered to perform their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron and his sons, as the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"This is what pertains to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward, they shall enter to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."
"And from the age of fifty years, they shall cease performing that service and serve no longer."
"Instead, they shall assist their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, but they shall do no service. This is what you shall do regarding the Levites and their duties."
