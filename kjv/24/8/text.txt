At that time, says the LORD, they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.
They will spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, served, followed, sought, and worshipped; they will not be gathered or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the earth.
And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them, says the LORD of hosts.
Moreover, you shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: Will they fall and not rise? Will he turn away and not return?
Why then has this people of Jerusalem slid back with a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.
I listened and heard, but they did not speak rightly: no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turned to his course, like a horse rushing into battle.
Yes, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtle, the crane, and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people do not know the judgment of the LORD.
How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Behold, certainly in vain he made it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.
The wise men are ashamed; they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?
Therefore, I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will inherit them: for everyone, from the least to the greatest, is given to covetousness; from the prophet to the priest, everyone deals falsely.
For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they could not even blush: therefore, they shall fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation, they shall be cast down, says the LORD.
I will surely consume them, says the LORD: there will be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf will fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter the fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence and given us gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold, trouble!
The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they have come and devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those who dwell therein.
For behold, I will send serpents, vipers among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, says the LORD.
When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint within me.
Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of those who dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? Is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and strange vanities?
The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
For the hurt of the daughter of my people, I am hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold of me.
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is the health of the daughter of my people not recovered?
