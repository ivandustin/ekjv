The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD was this:
"Arise, and go down to the potter's house; there I will let you hear my words."
So I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels.
The vessel he made of clay was marred in the potter's hand, so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter does? declares the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
At what moment I speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to uproot, tear down, and destroy it;
If that nation, against which I have pronounced judgment, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster I intended to bring upon them.
And at what moment I speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
If it does evil in my sight, refusing to obey my voice, then I will relent of the good I intended to do for them.
Now therefore, go and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am devising disaster against you and planning harm against you. Return, each of you, from your evil ways, and amend your ways and your deeds.'
But they said, 'There is no hope; we will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'
Therefore, thus says the LORD: 'Ask now among the nations, who has heard such things? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon, which comes from the rock of the field? Or will cold flowing waters from another place be forsaken?
Because my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to worthless idols, and they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in paths not built up;
To make their land a desolation, a perpetual hissing; everyone who passes by will be astonished and shake his head.
I will scatter them like chaff before the wind, before the enemy; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their calamity.'
Then they said, 'Come, let us devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.'
Give heed to me, O LORD, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
Should evil be repaid with good? For they have dug a pit for my life. Remember that I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
Therefore, deliver up their children to famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; let their wives become widows and bereaved of their children; let their men be put to death, let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
Let a cry be heard from their houses when you bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have dug a pit to take me and hidden snares for my feet.
Yet, O LORD, you know all their plans against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from your sight, but let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger."
