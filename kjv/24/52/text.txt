Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.  
He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following the example of Jehoiakim.  
Because of the anger of the LORD, it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon, until he had cast them out from His presence.  
In the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth month and the tenth day, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came with all his army against Jerusalem, pitched against it, and built forts around it.  
Thus, the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.  
In the fourth month, on the ninth day, there was a severe famine in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.  
Then the city was breached, and all the men of war fled by night through the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (the Chaldeans were surrounding the city:) and they went by the way of the plain.  
But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; all his army was scattered from him.  
They captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where judgment was pronounced upon him.  
The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also executed all the princes of Judah at Riblah.  
Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him in chains, and took him to Babylon, where he was imprisoned until the day of his death.  
Now, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.  
He burned down the house of the LORD, the king's house, all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men.  
The entire army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem surrounding it.  
Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away captive some of the poor of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.  
However, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left some of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.  
The pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, along with the bases and the bronze sea, were broken by the Chaldeans, who carried all the brass to Babylon.  
They also took the caldrons, shovels, snuffers, bowls, spoons, and all the brass vessels used in their service.  
The basins, firepans, bowls, caldrons, candlesticks, spoons, and cups; everything made of gold and silver was taken away by the captain of the guard.  
The two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, were too heavy to weigh.  
Regarding the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; a fillet of twelve cubits encircled it, and its thickness was four fingers: it was hollow.  
A brass chapiter was on top of it; the height of one chapiter was five cubits, adorned with network and pomegranates all around, all made of brass. The second pillar and its pomegranates were similar.  
There were ninety-six pomegranates on one side, and all the pomegranates on the network were a hundred all around.  
The captain of the guard took Seraiah, the chief priest, Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the door.  
He also took an eunuch from the city who was in charge of the men of war, seven men close to the king, the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people found in the city.  
So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.  
The king of Babylon struck them down and executed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus, Judah was carried away captive from its own land.  
This is the number of people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.  
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons.  
In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away captive seven hundred forty-five Jews: the total number of captives was four thousand and six hundred.  
It came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and brought him out of prison.  
He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.  
He changed his prison garments, and Jehoiachin continually ate bread before him all the days of his life.  
For his diet, a daily portion was provided by the king of Babylon until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
