The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, was as follows:  
"Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and offer them wine to drink."  
So I took Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, son of Habaziniah, along with his brothers, all his sons, and the entire house of the Rechabites;  
and I brought them into the house of the LORD, to the chamber of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was adjacent to the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, the keeper of the door.  
I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots filled with wine and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine."  
But they replied, "We will not drink wine; for Jonadab, son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons, forever.  
You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any of these; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, so that you may live many days in the land where you are strangers.'"  
Thus, we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us: we drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;  
nor do we build houses for ourselves to dwell in; we have no vineyard, field, or seed.  
Instead, we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed, doing according to all that Jonadab, our father, commanded us.  
However, when Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came up into the land, we said, "Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians," so we dwell in Jerusalem.  
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 'Will you not receive instruction to heed my words?' says the LORD.  
The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have been fulfilled; for to this day they drink none, obeying their father's commandment. Yet I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not heeded me.  
I have also sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, 'Return now every man from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and your fathers.' But you have not inclined your ear nor heeded me.  
Because the sons of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have fulfilled their father's commandment, but this people has not heeded me:  
Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered."  
And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab, your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you:  
Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab, son of Rechab, shall not lack a man to stand before me forever."
