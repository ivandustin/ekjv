Thus says the LORD: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and deliver this message there.  
And say, "Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits upon the throne of David, you, your servants, and your people who enter through these gates."  
Thus says the LORD: Execute judgment and righteousness, and rescue the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor. Do not wrong or commit violence against the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.  
For if you truly do this, then kings will enter through the gates of this house, sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.  
But if you refuse to listen to these words, I swear by myself, says the LORD, that this house will become a desolation.  
For thus says the LORD concerning the king's house of Judah: You are to me like Gilead and the head of Lebanon; yet I will surely make you a wilderness, and cities that are uninhabited.  
I will prepare destroyers against you, each with their weapons, and they will cut down your choice cedars and cast them into the fire.  
Many nations will pass by this city, and they will say to one another, "Why has the LORD done this to this great city?"  
Then they will answer, "Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and have worshipped other gods and served them."  
Do not weep for the dead, nor mourn for him; weep rather for him who goes away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native land.  
For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned in place of his father Josiah, who went out from this place: He shall not return there anymore.  
But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and he shall see this land no more.  
Woe to him who builds his house with unrighteousness and his chambers with wrong; who uses his neighbor's service without wages and does not give him what he deserves.  
Who says, "I will build myself a spacious house and large chambers, and I will cut out windows for it; it is paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion."  
Will you reign because you enclose yourself in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.  
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Was this not to know me? says the LORD.  
But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness, for shedding innocent blood, for oppression, and for violence.  
Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him, saying, "Ah, my brother!" or "Ah, sister!" They shall not lament for him, saying, "Ah, lord!" or "Ah, his glory!"  
He shall be buried like a donkey, dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.  
Go up to Lebanon and cry out; lift up your voice in Bashan and cry from the passages, for all your lovers are destroyed.  
I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, "I will not hear." This has been your manner since your youth; you have not obeyed my voice.  
The wind shall consume all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; then you shall be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.  
O inhabitant of Lebanon, nesting in the cedars, how gracious will you be when pangs come upon you, like the pain of a woman in labor!  
As I live, says the LORD, even if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on my right hand, I would still pull you off.  
And I will give you into the hands of those who seek your life, and into the hands of those whose face you fear, even into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans.  
And I will cast you out, along with your mother who bore you, into another country where you were not born; and there you shall die.  
But to the land to which they long to return, they shall not return.  
Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? Is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure? Why are he and his offspring cast out into a land they do not know?  
O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.  
Thus says the LORD: Write this man as childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judah.
