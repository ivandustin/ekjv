The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army, along with all the kingdoms under his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem and its cities, was as follows:

Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

You shall not escape from his grasp; you will surely be captured and delivered into his hands. Your eyes will see the king of Babylon, and he will speak to you face to face, and you shall go to Babylon.

Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: Thus says the LORD concerning you, You shall not die by the sword.

Instead, you shall die in peace; and as the burning of your ancestors, the former kings who were before you, so shall they burn incense for you; and they will mourn for you, saying, "Alas, my lord!" For I have declared the word, says the LORD.

Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Jerusalem.

When the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem and all the remaining cities of Judah, including Lachish and Azekah, for these fortified cities were the last of the cities of Judah.

This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them.

That every man should let his Hebrew manservant and his Hebrew maidservant go free; that none should keep his fellow Jew in servitude.

Now when all the princes and the people who had entered into the covenant heard that everyone should let their manservants and maidservants go free, they obeyed and released them.

But afterward, they changed their minds and forced the servants and handmaids they had set free to return, bringing them back into servitude.

Therefore, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:

Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:

At the end of seven years, every man shall let go of his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you; and when he has served you for six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your ancestors did not listen to me or incline their ear.

And now you have turned and done what is right in my sight by proclaiming liberty to each man to his neighbor; and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name.

But you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid, whom he had set free at their pleasure, to return, and brought them back into servitude.

Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not listened to me in proclaiming liberty, each one to his brother and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim liberty for you, says the LORD, to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine; and I will make you a terror among all the kingdoms of the earth.

And I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts,

The princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;

I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives; their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.

And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his princes, I will give into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, which has gone up from you.

Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; they shall fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
