Thus says the LORD to me: "Go and acquire a linen belt, and wear it around your waist, but do not put it in water."  
So I obtained a belt as instructed by the LORD and wore it around my waist.  
Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,  
"Take the belt you have, which is around your waist, and rise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a crevice of the rock."  
So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.  
After many days, the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and retrieve the belt from the place where I commanded you to hide it."  
I then went to the Euphrates, dug, and took the belt from the spot where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined, it was worthless.  
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Thus says the LORD: In this way, I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.  
This wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and follow other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt, which is good for nothing.  
For just as the belt clings to a man's waist, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me," says the LORD, "that they might be my people, for a name, for praise, and for glory; but they would not listen.  
Therefore, you shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Every jug will be filled with wine.' And they will say to you, 'Do we not certainly know that every jug will be filled with wine?'  
Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.  
And I will dash them against one another, even the fathers and the sons together,' says the LORD. 'I will not show pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but will destroy them.'  
Listen and pay attention; do not be proud, for the LORD has spoken.  
Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains; while you look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death and makes it deep darkness.  
But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and flow with tears, because the LORD's flock is taken captive.  
Say to the king and the queen, 'Humble yourselves, sit down; for your crowns will come down, even the glory of your majesty.'  
The cities of the south will be shut up, and no one will open them; Judah will be completely carried away captive.  
Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given to you, your beautiful flock?  
What will you say when he punishes you? For you have taught them to be leaders, and they are now your chief; will not sorrows seize you like a woman in labor?  
And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' It is because of the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are uncovered and your heels exposed.  
Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, who are accustomed to doing evil.  
Therefore, I will scatter them like chaff that passes away in the wind of the wilderness.  
This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, says the LORD; because you have forgotten me and trusted in falsehood.  
Therefore, I will expose your skirts to your face, so that your shame may be seen.  
I have seen your adulteries, your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, and your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! Will you not be made clean? When will it ever be?"
