Here are the edited lines of the text:

Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders who were taken captive, as well as to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;  
(After Jeconiah the king, the queen, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the carpenters, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem;)  
By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be taken from Jerusalem to Babylon;  
Build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit;  
Take wives and beget sons and daughters; take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that you may be increased there and not diminished.  
And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in its peace you shall have peace.  
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and diviners who are among you deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.  
For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, says the LORD.  
For thus says the LORD: After seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in bringing you back to this place.  
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.  
Then you will call upon me, and you will go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  
And you will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart.  
I will be found by you, says the LORD; and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD; and I will bring you back to the place from which I caused you to be carried away captive.  
Because you have said, "The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon;"  
Know that thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity;  
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.  
I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and I will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them:  
Because they have not heeded my words, says the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear, says the LORD.  
Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes;  
And a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;"  
Because they have committed wickedness in Israel, have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, says the LORD.  
Thus you shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  
"The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man who is mad and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison and in the stocks."  
Now therefore, why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you?  
For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "This captivity is long: build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit."  
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  
Send to all those of the captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he caused you to trust in a lie:  
Therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for my people, says the LORD; because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.
