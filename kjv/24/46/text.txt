The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Gentiles;
Against Egypt, specifically the army of Pharaohnecho, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, where Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, struck down in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near for battle.
Harness the horses; rise up, you horsemen, and stand ready with your helmets; sharpen the spears, and don the armor.
Why have I seen them dismayed and retreating? Their mighty ones are beaten down and have fled quickly, not looking back, for fear surrounds them, says the LORD.
Let not the swift escape, nor the mighty man flee; they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
Who is this that rises like a flood, whose waters surge like rivers?
Egypt rises like a flood, and its waters surge like rivers; it declares, "I will ascend and cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants."
Come forth, you horses; rage, you chariots; let the mighty men advance; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, who wield the shield; and the Lydians, who handle and bend the bow.
For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, to avenge Himself on His adversaries: the sword shall consume and be filled and intoxicated with their blood, for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the northern region by the river Euphrates.
Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many remedies; for you shall not be healed.
The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land: for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they have both fallen together.
The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning how Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and strike the land of Egypt.
Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and proclaim in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say, "Stand firm and prepare yourself; for the sword shall consume all around you."
Why are your valiant men swept away? They did not stand, for the LORD drove them back.
He caused many to fall; indeed, one fell upon another: and they said, "Arise, and let us return to our own people and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword."
They cried out there, "Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is but a noise; he has missed the appointed time."
As I live, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel is by the sea, so shall he come.
O daughter dwelling in Egypt, prepare yourself to go into captivity; for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
Egypt is like a very beautiful heifer, but destruction comes; it comes from the north.
Her hired men are in her midst like fatted bullocks; they too have turned back and fled together: they did not stand, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, and the time of their visitation.
The voice of her destruction shall be like a serpent; for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes, as woodcutters.
They shall cut down her forest, says the LORD, though it cannot be searched; for they are more numerous than the locusts and are innumerable.
The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hands of the people from the north.
The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, along with their gods and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all who trust in him.
And I will deliver them into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hands of his servants; and afterward, it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says the LORD.
But do not fear, O my servant Jacob, and do not be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save you from afar, and your descendants from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be at rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, says the LORD: for I am with you; I will make a complete end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a complete end of you; I will correct you in measure; yet I will not leave you wholly unpunished.
