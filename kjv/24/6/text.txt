O children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee from Jerusalem, blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil approaches from the north, and great destruction is imminent.  
I have compared the daughter of Zion to a beautiful and delicate woman.  
The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents around her; each shall feed in their own place.  
Prepare for war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day is fading, and the shadows of evening are stretching long.  
Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.  
For thus says the LORD of hosts, Cut down trees, and build a siege mound against Jerusalem: this city is to be visited; she is entirely oppression in her midst.  
As a fountain pours out her waters, so she pours out her wickedness: violence and plunder are heard in her; before me is constant grief and wounds.  
Be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land uninhabited.  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine: turn back your hand like a grape gatherer into the baskets.  
To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they take no delight in it.  
Therefore I am filled with the fury of the LORD; I am weary of holding it in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.  
And their houses shall be given to others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, says the LORD.  
For from the least of them to the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet to the priest, everyone deals falsely.  
They have also healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.  
Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them, they shall be cast down, says the LORD.  
Thus says the LORD, Stand in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk in it, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in it.  
Also, I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not listen.  
Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.  
Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but have rejected it.  
To what purpose does incense from Sheba come to me, and sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices sweet to me.  
Therefore thus says the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.  
Thus says the LORD, Behold, a people comes from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the ends of the earth.  
They shall take hold of bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array as men for war against you, O daughter of Zion.  
We have heard of their fame: our hands grow weak; anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, like that of a woman in labor.  
Do not go out into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear are on every side.  
O daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth, and roll in ashes: make mourning as for an only son, a most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.  
I have set you as a tower and a fortress among my people, that you may know and test their ways.  
They are all grievous rebels, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.  
The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.  
Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD has rejected them.
