The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah regarding the drought.  
Judah mourns, and its gates are in despair; they are darkened to the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem has risen.  
Their nobles have sent their children to the water sources; they went to the cisterns but found no water; they returned with their containers empty, ashamed and confused, covering their heads.  
The ground is parched because there has been no rain in the land; the plowmen are ashamed and cover their heads.  
Indeed, the doe also gives birth in the field and abandons her young because there is no grass.  
The wild donkeys stand on the barren heights, sniffing the wind like dragons; their eyes fail because there is no grass.  
O LORD, although our iniquities testify against us, act for your name's sake: for our backslidings are numerous; we have sinned against you.  
O hope of Israel, our savior in times of trouble, why should you be like a stranger in the land, and like a traveler who turns aside to stay for a night?  
Why should you be like a man astonished, like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet you, O LORD, are in our midst, and we are called by your name; do not forsake us.  
Thus says the LORD to this people: They have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet; therefore, the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins.  
Then the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for this people for their good."  
When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, famine, and pestilence.  
Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"  
Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I command them, nor did I speak to them: they prophesy to you a false vision, divination, and the deceit of their own hearts."  
Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, whom I did not send, yet they say, "Sword and famine shall not be in this land"; by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.  
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and no one will bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters: for I will pour out their wickedness upon them.  
Therefore, you shall say this word to them: "Let my eyes flow with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow."  
If I go out into the field, behold the slain with the sword! And if I enter the city, behold those who are sick with famine! Yes, both the prophet and the priest wander in a land they do not know.  
Have you utterly rejected Judah? Has your soul loathed Zion? Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but there is no good; and for a time of healing, behold trouble!  
We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against you.  
Do not abhor us for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, do not break your covenant with us.  
Are there any among the idols of the Gentiles that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Are you not he, O LORD our God? Therefore, we will wait upon you: for you have made all these things.
