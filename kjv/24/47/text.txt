The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.  
Thus says the LORD: Behold, waters rise from the north, and will become an overflowing flood, inundating the land and all that is in it; the city and its inhabitants will be affected; then the men will cry out, and all the people of the land will wail.  
At the sound of the pounding of the hooves of his powerful horses, at the rush of his chariots, and at the rumble of his wheels, fathers will not turn back to their children due to weakness of hands;  
Because of the day that is coming to devastate all the Philistines, and to cut off every helper that remains from Tyre and Sidon: for the LORD will bring ruin upon the Philistines, the remnant of the land of Caphtor.  
Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off along with the remnant of their valley: how long will you continue to harm yourself?  
O sword of the LORD, how long will it be before you are quiet? Sheathe yourself, rest, and be still.  
How can it be quiet, since the LORD has given it a command against Ashkelon and the seashore? There He has appointed it.
