The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was also the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.  
For at that time, the army of Babylon besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison, which was located in the house of the king of Judah.  
Zedekiah, king of Judah, had imprisoned him, asking, "Why do you prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?'"  
And Zedekiah, king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans; he will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak to him face to face, and his eyes will see his eyes.  
He will lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he will remain until I visit him, says the LORD; even if you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.  
Then Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
'Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, will come to you, saying, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it."  
So Hanameel, my uncle's son, came to me in the court of the prison, as the word of the LORD had said, and said to me, "Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the territory of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself." Then I realized that this was the word of the LORD.  
And I bought the field from Hanameel, my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed out the money to him, even seventeen shekels of silver.  
I signed the deed, sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances.  
So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open.  
And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the presence of Hanameel, my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.  
And I instructed Baruch before them, saying,  
'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both that which is sealed and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last for many days.  
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses, fields, and vineyards shall again be possessed in this land.'  
Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch, the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,  
'Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you.  
You show lovingkindness to thousands, and you repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is your name.  
Great in counsel and mighty in work; for your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.  
You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and you have made a name for yourself, as at this day.  
And you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.  
And you have given them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  
They came in and possessed it; but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do; therefore, you have caused all this evil to come upon them.  
Behold, the mounts have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence; and what you have spoken has come to pass; and behold, you see it.  
And you have said to me, O Lord GOD, "Buy the field for money and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."  
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  
'Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is there anything too hard for me?  
Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and he shall take it.  
And the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set fire to it, and burn it, along with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, provoking me to anger.  
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth; the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.  
For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,  
Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
They have turned their back to me and not their face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not heeded to receive instruction.  
But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.  
And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it come into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.  
And now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you say, "It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."  
Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in my anger, in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.  
They shall be my people, and I will be their God.  
And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good and for the good of their children after them.  
And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, so that they will not depart from me.  
Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land with my whole heart and with my whole soul.  
For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.  
And fields shall be bought in this land, of which you say, "It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."  
Men shall buy fields for money, subscribe evidences, seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south; for I will cause their captivity to return, says the LORD.'
