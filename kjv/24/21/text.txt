The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent Pashur, the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
"Please inquire of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is waging war against us. Perhaps the LORD will act toward us according to all His wondrous works, so that He may withdraw from us."
Then Jeremiah said to them, "You shall say to Zedekiah:
Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls, and I will gather them in the midst of this city.
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a strong arm, in anger, fury, and great wrath.
I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence.
And afterward, says the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his officials, and the people, and those who remain in this city from the pestilence, the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives; he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, nor show pity, nor have mercy.
And to this people, you shall say, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live, and his life shall be as a prize for him.
For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear the word of the LORD:
O house of David, thus says the LORD: Administer justice in the morning, and rescue the one who has been robbed from the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go forth like fire and burn with no one to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds.
Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain, says the LORD; who say, "Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter our dwellings?"
But I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds, says the LORD; and I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall consume everything around it.
