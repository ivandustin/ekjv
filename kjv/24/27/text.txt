In the early days of Jehoiakim's reign, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  
The LORD said to me: Create bonds and yokes, and place them around your neck,  
And send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, through the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah, king of Judah;  
And instruct them to tell their masters: This is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; you shall say this to your masters:  
I have created the earth, along with the people and animals on it, by my great power and outstretched arm, and I have given it to whomever I choose.  
And now, I have handed all these lands over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; and I have also given him the beasts of the field to serve him.  
All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson, until the time of his land comes; then many nations and great kings will make themselves his servants.  
It will come to pass that any nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and does not submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish, says the LORD, with the sword, famine, and pestilence, until I have destroyed them by his hand.  
Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, diviners, dreamers, enchanters, or sorcerers, who tell you, "You shall not serve the king of Babylon."  
For they prophesy lies to you, aiming to distance you from your land; they seek to drive you out, and you will perish.  
But the nations that submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will allow to remain in their own land, says the LORD; they will cultivate it and live there.  
I also spoke to Zedekiah, king of Judah, with all these words, saying, "Submit your necks to the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and you will live."  
Why would you and your people die by the sword, famine, and pestilence, as the LORD has declared against the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?  
Therefore, do not heed the words of the prophets who tell you, "You shall not serve the king of Babylon," for they prophesy lies to you.  
For I have not sent them, says the LORD, yet they prophesy falsely in my name; their goal is to drive you out and lead to your destruction, along with the prophets who prophesy to you.  
I also addressed the priests and all the people, saying, "This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who tell you, 'The vessels of the LORD's house will soon be brought back from Babylon,' for they prophesy lies to you."  
Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city be destroyed?  
But if they are true prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the remaining vessels in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon.  
For this is what the LORD of hosts says regarding the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the remaining vessels in this city.  
These are the vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take when he carried away captive Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;  
Indeed, this is what the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says about the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem;  
They will be taken to Babylon, and they will remain there until the day I visit them, says the LORD; then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.
