Now I say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.
But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
To redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Wherefore you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
Howbeit then, when you knew not God, you did service unto those which by nature are no gods.
But now, after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?
You observe days, and months, and times, and years.
I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.
Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as you are: you have not injured me at all.
You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.
And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? For I bear you record that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.
Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
They zealously affect you, but not for good; yea, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.
But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.
My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from Mount Sinai, which genders to bondage, which is Agar.
For this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath a husband.
Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.
Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
