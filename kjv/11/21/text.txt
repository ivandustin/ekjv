And it came to pass after these events that Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard located in Jezreel, adjacent to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.  
And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard so that I may have it for a garden of herbs, since it is close to my house. I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or if you prefer, I will pay you its value in money."  
But Naboth replied to Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors."  
Ahab returned to his home sullen and angry because of Naboth's response: he had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and refused to eat.  
Then Jezebel, his wife, came to him and asked, "Why is your spirit so sad that you do not eat?"  
He answered her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said, 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in exchange.' But he replied, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"  
Jezebel, his wife, said to him, "Are you now the king of Israel? Get up, eat, and let your heart be cheerful; I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."  
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and nobles in his city, where Naboth lived.  
In the letters, she instructed, "Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.  
And set two men, sons of Belial, opposite him to testify against him, saying, 'You have blasphemed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death."  
The men of the city, including the elders and nobles who lived there, acted as Jezebel had instructed and followed the contents of the letters she sent.  
They proclaimed a fast and placed Naboth in a prominent position among the people.  
Then two men, children of Belial, came in and sat before him. The men of Belial testified against Naboth in front of the people, saying, "Naboth has blasphemed God and the king." They then took him outside the city and stoned him to death.  
Afterward, they sent a message to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."  
When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab, "Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to sell you for money, for Naboth is dead."  
When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.  
Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  
"Arise, go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria; he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.  
You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: Have you murdered and also taken possession?' You shall say to him, 'Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.'"  
Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD.  
Behold, I will bring calamity upon you, and will cut off your descendants, and will eliminate from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel.  
I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger and caused Israel to sin.  
And concerning Jezebel, the LORD said, 'The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.  
Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city, the dogs shall eat; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the air shall eat.'"  
But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel, his wife, stirred up.  
He acted very abominably in following idols, as the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.  
When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, fasted, lay in sackcloth, and went about softly.  
Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  
"Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the calamity in his days; but in his son's days, I will bring the calamity upon his house."
