They maintained three years of peace without conflict between Syria and Israel.  
In the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, visited the king of Israel.  
The king of Israel addressed his servants, saying, "Do you not know that Ramoth in Gilead belongs to us? Why are we still sitting idle and not taking it from the king of Syria?"  
He then asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you join me in battle at Ramothgilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are; my people are your people, and my horses are your horses."  
Jehoshaphat urged the king of Israel, "Please inquire today of the word of the LORD."  
The king of Israel gathered about four hundred prophets and asked them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramothgilead, or should I refrain?" They answered, "Go up, for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand."  
Jehoshaphat then asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of?"  
The king of Israel replied, "There is one man, Micaiah son of Imlah, through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, only evil." Jehoshaphat responded, "Let not the king say so."  
The king of Israel then called an officer and said, "Hasten to bring Micaiah son of Imlah."  
The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat sat on their thrones, dressed in their robes, in a designated area at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, while all the prophets prophesied before them.  
Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns and declared, "Thus says the LORD: With these you shall push the Syrians until you have destroyed them."  
All the prophets prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramothgilead and succeed, for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand."  
The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the words of the prophets are unanimous in declaring good to the king. Please let your word be like theirs and speak favorably."  
Micaiah replied, "As the LORD lives, whatever the LORD says to me, that will I speak."  
When he came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to battle against Ramothgilead, or shall we refrain?" Micaiah answered, "Go and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand."  
The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"  
Micaiah replied, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These have no master; let each return home in peace.'"  
The king of Israel turned to Jehoshaphat and said, "Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but only evil?"  
Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside Him, on His right and on His left."  
The LORD asked, "Who will persuade Ahab to go up and fall at Ramothgilead?" One spirit suggested one thing, and another spirit suggested another.  
Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, "I will persuade him."  
The LORD asked, "How?" The spirit replied, "I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets." The LORD said, "You will persuade him and succeed; go and do it."  
So now, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets, and the LORD has declared disaster against you.  
Zedekiah son of Chenaanah approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek, asking, "Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"  
Micaiah replied, "You will see on that day when you go to hide in an inner chamber."  
The king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son.  
Tell them, 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction until I return in peace.'"  
Micaiah declared, "If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken through me." He added, "Listen, all you people!"  
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat went up to Ramothgilead.  
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and enter the battle, but you wear your robes." The king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.  
The king of Syria commanded his thirty-two captains of chariots, saying, "Do not fight with anyone small or great, except the king of Israel."  
When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "Surely this is the king of Israel." They turned to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.  
When the captains of the chariots realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.  
A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. He said to the charioteer, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded."  
The battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died in the evening, and blood flowed from the wound into the chariot.  
A proclamation was made throughout the army at sunset, saying, "Every man to his city, and every man to his own country."  
So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where he was buried.  
Someone washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, as was prophesied by the word of the LORD.  
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, all that he did, the ivory house he built, and all the cities he constructed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  
Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.  
Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.  
Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.  
He walked in all the ways of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD; however, the high places were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.  
Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.  
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his might, and how he waged war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
He removed the remnant of the male cult prostitutes that remained in the days of his father Asa.  
At that time, there was no king in Edom; a deputy served as king.  
Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Eziongeber.  
Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat refused.  
Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king.  
Ahaziah son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned for two years over Israel.  
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his father, his mother, and Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.  
He served Baal, worshipped him, and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, just as his father had done.
