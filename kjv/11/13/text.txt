And behold, a man of God came from Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel, where Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.  
He cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, saying, "O altar, altar! Thus says the LORD: Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, named Josiah; and he shall offer the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you."  
He provided a sign that same day, saying, "This is the sign the LORD has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out."  
When King Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him!" But his hand, which he stretched out against him, withered so that he could not pull it back.  
The altar was also torn apart, and the ashes were poured out from it, in accordance with the sign the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.  
The king then said to the man of God, "Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored." The man of God prayed to the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.  
The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward."  
But the man of God said to the king, "If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.  
For it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.'"  
So he went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.  
Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel, including the words he had spoken to the king.  
Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" For his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.  
He said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey, and he rode on it,  
and went after the man of God, finding him sitting under an oak. He asked him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And he replied, "I am."  
Then he said, "Come home with me and eat bread."  
But he answered, "I cannot return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place.  
For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water there, nor return by the same way you came.'"  
The old prophet said to him, "I am a prophet also, as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he lied to him.  
So the man of God went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.  
As they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back,  
and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God commanded you,  
but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the LORD said to you, 'Eat no bread and drink no water,' your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers."  
After he had eaten bread and drunk, the old prophet saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet he had brought back.  
When he had gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him; and his body was thrown in the way, and the donkey stood by it, and the lion also stood by the body.  
Behold, men passed by and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; they went and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.  
When the prophet who had brought him back heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke to him."  
He spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." And they saddled it.  
He went and found the body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body; the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.  
The prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back; the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him.  
He laid the body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, "Alas, my brother!"  
After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, "When I die, bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.  
For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass."  
After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways, but again appointed priests from the lowest of the people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.  
This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, leading to its destruction and cutting it off from the face of the earth.
