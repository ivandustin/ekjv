Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent his servants to Solomon because he had heard that Solomon was anointed king in place of his father; Hiram had always been a supporter of David.  
Solomon responded to Hiram, saying,  
"You know that my father David was unable to build a house for the name of the LORD his God due to the wars surrounding him until the LORD subdued his enemies."  
"But now the LORD my God has granted me peace on all sides, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence."  
"Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to my father David, saying, 'Your son, whom I will place on your throne in your stead, will build a house for my name.'"  
"Therefore, command that they cut cedar trees for me from Lebanon; my servants will work alongside yours, and I will pay your servants according to your specifications, for you know that none among us can skillfully cut timber like the Sidonians."  
When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the LORD today, for He has given David a wise son to lead this great people."  
Hiram sent a message to Solomon, saying, "I have considered your requests, and I will fulfill all your desires regarding cedar and fir timber."  
"My servants will transport them from Lebanon to the sea, and I will arrange for them to be delivered by sea to the location you specify, where you will receive them, and you will provide food for my household."  
Thus, Hiram provided Solomon with cedar and fir trees according to all his requests.  
In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for his household's food and twenty measures of pure oil; this was Solomon's annual gift to Hiram.  
The LORD granted Solomon wisdom, as He had promised, and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; they formed a partnership.  
King Solomon raised a levy from all Israel, consisting of thirty thousand men.  
He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand each month: they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home, with Adoniram overseeing the levy.  
Solomon also had seventy thousand men to carry burdens and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains;  
In addition to the chief officers overseeing the work, there were three thousand three hundred who supervised the laborers.  
The king commanded that great stones, costly stones, and hewn stones be brought in to lay the foundation of the house.  
Solomon's builders, along with Hiram's builders and the stonecutters, prepared the timber and stones needed to construct the house.
