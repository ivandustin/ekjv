Now King David was old and advanced in years; they covered him with blankets, but he felt no warmth.
Therefore, his servants said to him, "Let us find a young virgin for my lord the king; let her stand before the king, cherish him, and lie in his bosom, so that my lord the king may feel warmth."
So they searched for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territories of Israel and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
The young woman was very beautiful and cared for the king, ministering to him, but the king did not know her intimately.
Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." He prepared chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
His father had never displeased him by asking, "Why have you done this?" He was also a very handsome man, and his mother bore him after Absalom.
He conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and Abiathar the priest; they followed Adonijah and supported him.
But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah.
Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is near Enrogel, and invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
However, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon, his brother, he did not invite.
Therefore, Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, saying, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, is reigning, and our lord David knows nothing about it?
Now, therefore, come, let me give you counsel, so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
Go to King David and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your servant, saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne"? Why then does Adonijah reign?'
Behold, while you are still speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words."
Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber; the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to him.
Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king. The king asked, "What do you want?"
She said to him, "My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your servant, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.'
Now, behold, Adonijah reigns, and you, my lord the king, do not know it.
He has sacrificed oxen, fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he has not called Solomon, your servant.
And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
Otherwise, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders."
While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
They told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." When he came in before the king, he bowed with his face to the ground.
Nathan said, "My lord, O king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne'?
For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen, fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him and say, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not called.
Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not shown it to your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
Then King David answered, "Call me Bathsheba." She came into the king's presence and stood before him.
The king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul from all distress,
Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place,' so will I certainly do this day."
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and did reverence to the king, saying, "Let my lord King David live forever."
King David said, "Call me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." They came before the king.
The king also said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel; blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'
Then you shall come up after him, so that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my place, and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, saying, "Amen! May the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
As the LORD has been with my lord the king, may He be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.
Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"
All the people followed him, piping with pipes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them.
Adonijah and all the guests with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "Why is this noise of the city in an uproar?"
While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, came; and Adonijah said to him, "Come in; for you are a valiant man and bring good tidings."
Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, "Indeed, our lord King David has made Solomon king.
The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule.
Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise you have heard.
And moreover, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
Furthermore, the king's servants have come to bless our lord King David, saying, 'May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
The king also said, 'Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'
All the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and they rose up and went every man his way.
Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, went, and took hold of the horns of the altar.
It was told Solomon, saying, "Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon; for he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.'"
Solomon said, "If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die."
So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed himself to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."
