And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered there to make him king.  
When Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was still in Egypt, heard of it (for he had fled from King Solomon and was living in Egypt),  
they sent for him. Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,  
"Your father made our yoke heavy; now, therefore, lighten the grievous service of your father and the heavy yoke he placed upon us, and we will serve you."  
He replied, "Depart for three days, then return to me." So the people departed.  
King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, and asked, "What do you advise that I should say to this people?"  
They answered him, "If you will be a servant to this people today, and serve them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever."  
But he rejected the counsel of the elders that they had given him and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now in his service.  
He asked them, "What advice do you have for me to respond to this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put upon us'?"  
The young men who had grown up with him replied, "This is what you should say to the people who have spoken to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us': say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.  
Now, whereas my father laid a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"  
So Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed, saying, "Come back to me on the third day."  
The king answered the people harshly and rejected the counsel of the elders.  
He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."  
Therefore, the king did not listen to the people, for the turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat.  
When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, David." So Israel went home.  
But the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  
Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.  
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.  
When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent for him and made him king over all Israel; only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.  
When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel and bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam, son of Solomon.  
But the word of God came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,  
"Speak to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  
'Thus says the LORD: You shall not go up or fight against your brethren, the children of Israel. Return every man to his house, for this thing is from Me.'" They heeded the word of the LORD and returned, as the LORD had commanded.  
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there; he went out from there and built Penuel.  
Jeroboam thought to himself, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.  
If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, their hearts will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam, king of Judah. They will kill me and return to Rehoboam, king of Judah."  
So the king took counsel and made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."  
He set one in Bethel and the other in Dan.  
This became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one at Dan.  
He made high places and appointed priests from among the people who were not of the sons of Levi.  
Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. He did the same in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places he had made.  
So he offered sacrifices on the altar he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month he had devised in his own heart, and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel. He offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense.
