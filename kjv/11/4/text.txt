King Solomon ruled over all of Israel.  
These were the princes he appointed: Azariah, the son of Zadok the priest,  
Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, who served as scribes; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, acted as the recorder.  
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the army, while Zadok and Abiathar served as priests.  
Azariah, the son of Nathan, oversaw the officers, and Zabud, the son of Nathan, was the principal officer and the king's friend.  
Ahishar managed the household, and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was responsible for the tribute.  
Solomon appointed twelve officers over all of Israel to provide provisions for the king and his household, with each man responsible for one month of the year.  
Here are their names: The son of Hur, in the region of Mount Ephraim;  
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan;  
The son of Hesed, in Aruboth, which included Sochoh and all the land of Hepher;  
The son of Abinadab, who governed all the region of Dor, and he had Taphath, the daughter of Solomon, as his wife;

The son of Geber was in Ramothgilead, overseeing the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan, which contained sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars;

Shimei, the son of Elah, was in Benjamin;  
Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Gilead, overseeing the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; he was the only officer in that region.  
Judah and Israel were numerous, like the sand by the sea, enjoying food, drink, and merriment.  
Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought gifts and served Solomon throughout his reign.  
Solomon's daily provisions included thirty measures of fine flour and sixty measures of meal,  
Ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, and a hundred sheep, along with harts, roebucks, fallow deer, and fatted fowl.  
He had dominion over all the region on this side of the river, from Tiphsah to Azzah, ruling over all the kings in that area, and he enjoyed peace on all sides.  
Judah and Israel lived securely, each under their own vine and fig tree, from Dan to Beersheba, throughout Solomon's reign.  
Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his horses and twelve thousand horsemen.  
The officers provided provisions for King Solomon and for all who came to his table, ensuring that everyone had what they needed each month.  
Barley and straw for the horses and dromedaries were brought to the designated place by the officers, each according to their responsibility.  
God granted Solomon immense wisdom and understanding, as well as a heart as vast as the sand on the seashore.  
Solomon's wisdom surpassed that of all the wise men from the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.  
He was wiser than all men, including Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; his fame spread throughout all nations.  
He spoke three thousand proverbs and composed one thousand and five songs.  
He discussed trees, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, birds, creeping things, and fish.  
People from all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, including kings from all over the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
