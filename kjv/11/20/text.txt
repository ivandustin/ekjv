And Benhadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his forces together: there were thirty-two kings with him, along with horses and chariots; he went up and besieged Samaria, waging war against it.  
He sent messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, in the city, saying, "Thus says Benhadad,  
'Your silver and gold are mine; your wives and children, the most beautiful, are also mine.'"  
The king of Israel replied, "My lord, O king, according to your word, I am yours, and all that I possess."  
The messengers returned, saying, "Thus speaks Benhadad: Although I have previously sent to you, saying, 'You shall deliver to me your silver, gold, wives, and children,'  
I will send my servants to you tomorrow at this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants; whatever is desirable in your eyes, they shall take in their hands and carry away."  
Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, "Please pay attention and see how this man seeks trouble: he sent to me for my wives, children, silver, and gold, and I did not deny him."  
All the elders and the people replied, "Do not listen to him or consent."  
So he told the messengers of Benhadad, "Tell my lord the king: All that you requested from your servant at first I will do; but this thing I cannot do." The messengers departed and brought him word again.  
Benhadad sent to him, saying, "May the gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria is enough for handfuls for all the people who follow me."  
The king of Israel answered, "Tell him, 'Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.'"  
When Benhadad heard this message, while he and the kings were drinking in the pavilions, he said to his servants, "Prepare yourselves." They prepared to attack the city.  
Then a prophet came to Ahab, king of Israel, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Have you seen this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD."  
Ahab asked, "By whom?" The prophet replied, "Thus says the LORD: By the young men of the princes of the provinces." Ahab then asked, "Who will lead the battle?" The prophet answered, "You."  
Ahab counted the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred thirty-two; after them, he counted all the people of Israel, totaling seven thousand.  
They went out at noon, but Benhadad was drinking heavily in the pavilions with the thirty-two kings who supported him.  
The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; Benhadad sent out messengers, who reported, "Men have come out of Samaria."  
He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."  
So the young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, followed by the army.  
They each struck down their opponent, and the Syrians fled; Israel pursued them, and Benhadad, king of Syria, escaped on a horse with the cavalry.  
The king of Israel went out, struck down the horses and chariots, and inflicted a great slaughter on the Syrians.  
The prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Go, strengthen yourself, and consider what you should do, for at the turn of the year, the king of Syria will come against you."  
The servants of the king of Syria said to him, "Their gods are gods of the hills; that is why they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they."  
"Do this: remove the kings, every man from his place, and put captains in their stead.  
Number an army like the army you lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they." He listened to their advice and did so.  
At the turn of the year, Benhadad numbered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.  
The children of Israel were numbered and all present, and they went against them; the children of Israel camped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the land.  
A man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, saying, "Thus says the LORD: Because the Syrians have said, 'The LORD is God of the hills, but not God of the valleys,' I will deliver this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD."  
They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle was joined, and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day.  
The rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who remained. Benhadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber.  
His servants said to him, "Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life."  
So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads, and went to the king of Israel, saying, "Your servant Benhadad says, 'Please let me live.'" Ahab replied, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."  
The men observed closely to see if any sign would come from him, and they quickly caught it, saying, "Your brother Benhadad." Ahab said, "Go, bring him." Benhadad came out to him, and Ahab took him up into the chariot.  
Benhadad said to him, "The cities my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria." Ahab replied, "I will send you away with this covenant." So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.  
A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD, "Strike me, I pray." But the man refused to strike him.  
Then he said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you." As soon as he left, a lion found him and killed him.  
He found another man and said, "Strike me, I pray." The man struck him, wounding him.  
The prophet departed, waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes on his face.  
As the king passed by, he cried out to the king: "Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me, saying, 'Guard this man; if he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'"  
While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, "Your judgment shall be as you have decided."  
He hurried and removed the ashes from his face, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.  
He said to him, "Thus says the LORD: Because you have let go of a man whom I appointed for destruction, your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people."  
The king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and he came to Samaria.
