King Solomon, however, had a deep affection for many foreign women, including the daughter of Pharaoh, as well as women from the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites.  
The LORD had warned the children of Israel about these nations, saying, "You shall not intermarry with them, nor shall they marry you, for they will surely turn your hearts away to their gods." Solomon was deeply attached to these women.  
He had seven hundred wives, who were princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives led his heart astray.  
As Solomon grew older, his wives turned his heart toward other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David.  
Solomon pursued Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, the detestable god of the Ammonites.  
He committed evil in the sight of the LORD and did not follow the LORD completely, as his father David had done.  
Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, on the hill opposite Jerusalem, and for Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.  
He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.  
The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.  
The LORD had commanded him not to follow other gods, but he did not keep the command of the LORD.  
Therefore, the LORD said to Solomon, "Since you have done this and have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.  
However, during your lifetime, I will not do it for the sake of your father David; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.  
Yet I will not take the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."  
The LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal line in Edom.  
This occurred when David was in Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain after he had killed every male in Edom.  
(For six months, Joab remained there with all Israel until he had cut off every male in Edom.)  
Hadad fled, along with certain Edomites who were servants of his father, to Egypt; Hadad was still a young child at that time.  
They left Midian and came to Paran, taking men with them from Paran, and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, provided him with food, and granted him land.  
Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, who gave him the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as a wife.  
Tahpenes' sister bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; Genubath lived in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.  
When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had died and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, "Let me go back to my own country."  
Pharaoh asked him, "What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" He answered, "Nothing, but please let me go."  
God stirred up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon son of Eliadah, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.  
Rezon gathered men to himself and became the leader of a band after David had killed the Zobahites; they went to Damascus and settled there, where he reigned.  
He was an adversary to Israel throughout Solomon's reign, in addition to the trouble caused by Hadad; he loathed Israel and ruled over Syria.  
Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite from Zereda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.  
The reason he rebelled against the king was that Solomon had built Millo and repaired the breaches in the city of David his father.  
Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he made him in charge of the labor force of the house of Joseph.  
At that time, when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; Jeroboam was wearing a new garment, and they were alone in the field.  
Ahijah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.  
He said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.  
(But he will have one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.)  
This is because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my statutes and judgments, as David his father did.  
However, I will not take the whole kingdom from him, but I will let him be prince all the days of his life for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose because he kept my commandments and statutes.  
But I will take the kingdom from his son's hand and give it to you, even ten tribes.  
To his son, I will give one tribe, so that my servant David may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to put my name there.  
I will take you, and you will reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.  
If you listen to all that I command you, and walk in my ways, and do what is right in my sight, keeping my statutes and commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.  
For this, I will afflict the descendants of David, but not forever.  
Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and remained there until Solomon's death.  
The rest of the acts of Solomon, including all that he did and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?  
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.  
He died and was buried in the city of David his father, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
