Solomon spent thirteen years constructing his own house, completing it in its entirety.  
He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, supported by four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams resting on them.  
The structure was covered with cedar above the beams, which rested on forty-five pillars, arranged with fifteen in each row.  
There were windows arranged in three rows, with light shining through in three tiers.  
All the doors and posts were square, matching the windows, with light shining through in three tiers.  
He constructed a porch with pillars; its length was fifty cubits and its breadth thirty cubits, positioned in front of them, with additional pillars and a thick beam in front.  
He also created a porch for the throne where he could judge, known as the porch of judgment, which was covered with cedar from one end to the other.  
His dwelling had another courtyard within the porch, designed similarly. Solomon also built a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married, resembling this porch.  
All these structures were made of costly stones, precisely measured and hewn, both inside and out, from the foundation to the coping, extending outward toward the great court.  
The foundation consisted of expensive stones, including large stones measuring ten cubits and eight cubits.  
Above the foundation were costly stones, shaped to size, along with cedar wood.  
The great court surrounding the area featured three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams, serving both the inner court of the house of the LORD and the porch of the house.  
King Solomon sent for Hiram from Tyre.  
Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali; his father was a man of Tyre, skilled in brasswork, and he was filled with wisdom, understanding, and skill in all brasswork. He came to King Solomon and completed all his tasks.  
He cast two brass pillars, each eighteen cubits high, with a twelve-cubit line encircling each one.  
He crafted two chapiters of molten brass to place atop the pillars; each chapiter was five cubits tall.  
He created nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters on top of the pillars, seven for one chapiter and seven for the other.  
He constructed the pillars and arranged two rows around each network to cover the chapiters with pomegranates, replicating this for the other chapiter.  
The chapiters atop the pillars featured lily designs in the porch, measuring four cubits.  
The chapiters on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, opposite the belly by the network, with two hundred pomegranates arranged in rows around the other chapiter.  
He erected the pillars in the porch of the temple, setting up the right pillar and naming it Jachin, and the left pillar, naming it Boaz.  
The tops of the pillars were adorned with lily work, completing the craftsmanship of the pillars.  
He made a molten sea, measuring ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was round and five cubits high, with a thirty-cubit line encircling it.  
Around the brim, there were knobs, ten in a cubit, encircling the sea; the knobs were cast in two rows during the casting process.  
The sea rested on twelve oxen, three facing north, three west, three south, and three east, with the sea positioned above them, their hind parts turned inward.  
It was a handbreadth thick, and the brim was crafted like the brim of a cup, adorned with lily flowers; it could hold two thousand baths.  
He made ten bases of brass; each base measured four cubits in length, four cubits in breadth, and three cubits in height.  
The bases were constructed with borders, and the borders were situated between the ledges.  
On the borders between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; above the ledges was a base, and beneath the lions and oxen were additional thin work.  
Each base had four brass wheels and plates of brass; the four corners had undersetters, and beneath the laver were molten undersetters beside each addition.  
The mouth within the chapiter was a cubit wide, but the mouth itself was round, measuring a cubit and a half, with engravings and borders that were square, not round.  
Under the borders were four wheels, with the axletrees of the wheels connected to the base; the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.  
The design of the wheels resembled that of chariot wheels, with molten axletrees, naves, felloes, and spokes.  
Each base had four undersetters at its corners, made from the same material as the base.  
Atop each base was a round compass, half a cubit high, with ledges and borders of the same design.  
On the plates of the ledges and borders, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportions of each, with additional designs around them.  
In this manner, he constructed the ten bases, all of which were cast in one piece, with uniform measurements and sizes.  
He then made ten lavers of brass; each laver held forty baths and measured four cubits, with one laver placed on each of the ten bases.  
He positioned five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side, placing the sea on the right side of the house, eastward, facing south.  
Hiram crafted the lavers, shovels, and basins. Thus, Hiram completed all the work he had done for King Solomon in the house of the LORD:  
The two pillars, the two bowls of the chapiters atop the pillars, and the two networks covering the bowls of the chapiters.  
He also made four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, with two rows of pomegranates for each network, covering the bowls of the chapiters on the pillars.  
Additionally, he created the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases,  
One sea, and twelve oxen beneath the sea,  
Along with pots, shovels, and basins; all these vessels that Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were made of bright brass.  
In the plain of Jordan, the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.  
Solomon left all the vessels unweighed due to their overwhelming quantity; the weight of the brass was not determined.  
Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, the table of gold for the showbread,  
The candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle, along with the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold,  
And the bowls, snuffers, basins, spoons, and censers of pure gold; the hinges of gold were for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the temple.  
Thus, all the work that King Solomon completed for the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon brought in the items that David, his father, had dedicated, including silver, gold, and vessels, placing them among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
