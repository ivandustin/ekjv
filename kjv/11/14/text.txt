At that time, Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, fell ill.
Jeroboam instructed his wife, "Arise, I beseech you, and disguise yourself so that you will not be recognized as Jeroboam's wife; go to Shiloh. There, you will find Ahijah the prophet, who foretold that I would be king over this people."
"Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will inform you of what will happen to the child."
Jeroboam's wife complied, rising and traveling to Shiloh, arriving at Ahijah's house. However, Ahijah was unable to see due to his old age.
The LORD spoke to Ahijah, saying, "Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you regarding her son, who is sick. You must tell her this: when she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else."
When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she entered the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you disguise yourself as another? I have been sent to you with heavy news."
"Go, tell Jeroboam, 'This is what the LORD God of Israel says: Since I exalted you from among the people and made you prince over my people Israel,
I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you; yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes;
but you have done more evil than all who came before you. You have made for yourself other gods and molten images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back.
Therefore, behold, I will bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, cutting off every male in Jeroboam's line, whether slave or free in Israel, and I will remove the remnant of Jeroboam's house as one removes dung until it is all gone.
Those who die in Jeroboam's city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by birds of the air, for the LORD has spoken it.
Now arise, go to your own house; when your feet enter the city, the child will die.
All Israel will mourn for him and bury him; he is the only one of Jeroboam's line who will be given a proper burial, for in him, something good was found toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
Furthermore, the LORD will raise up a king over Israel who will cut off Jeroboam's house that very day; but what? Even now.
For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; he will uproot Israel from this good land, which he gave to their ancestors, and scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and caused Israel to sin."
Jeroboam's wife arose, departed, and came to Tirzah; when she reached the threshold of the door, the child died.
They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had spoken through his servant Ahijah the prophet.
The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, including his wars and reign, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years; he rested with his ancestors, and his son Nadab succeeded him.
Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city chosen by the LORD from all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to jealousy with their sins, which were greater than those of their ancestors.
They built high places, images, and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.
There were also male cult prostitutes in the land, and they practiced all the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the children of Israel.
In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made.
In their place, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the chief of the guard, who kept watch at the door of the king's house.
Whenever the king went to the house of the LORD, the guards would carry them and then bring them back to the guardroom.
The rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns.
Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. His son Abijam succeeded him.
