And Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, bringing her to the city of David, until he completed the construction of his own palace, the house of the LORD, and the surrounding wall of Jerusalem.
Only the people offered sacrifices at high places, as there was no temple built in the name of the LORD up to that time.
Solomon loved the LORD, following the statutes of his father David; however, he sacrificed and burned incense at high places.
The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices there, for it was the most prominent high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
In Gibeon, the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night, and God said, "Ask what I shall give you."
Solomon replied, "You have shown great mercy to your servant David my father, as he walked before you in truth, righteousness, and uprightness of heart; and you have kept for him this great kindness by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.
And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, but I am just a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
Your servant is among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be counted.
Therefore, give your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, so I can discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this great people of yours?"
The speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked for this.
God said to him, "Because you have asked for this and not for long life, riches, or the life of your enemies, but for understanding to discern judgment;
Behold, I have done according to your words: I have given you a wise and understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before, nor shall any arise like you after.
I have also given you what you did not ask for, both riches and honor, so that there will not be anyone among the kings like you all your days.
And if you walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and commandments, as your father David did, then I will lengthen your days."
Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, offered burnt offerings, peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
Then two women, who were harlots, came to the king and stood before him.
One woman said, "O my lord, this woman and I live in one house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.
And on the third day after my child was born, this woman also gave birth; we were alone together in the house, with no one else present.
During the night, this woman's child died because she lay on him.
She arose at midnight, took my son from beside me while your servant slept, laid him in her bosom, and placed her dead child in my bosom.
When I awoke in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead; but when I examined him closely in the morning, I realized it was not my son whom I had borne."
The other woman said, "No! The living child is my son, and the dead one is yours." The first woman replied, "No! The dead one is your son, and the living one is mine." Thus they argued before the king.
Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who is alive, and your son is dead,' while the other says, 'No! Your son is dead, and my son is alive.'"
The king ordered, "Bring me a sword." They brought a sword before the king.
The king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other."
Then the woman whose child was alive spoke to the king, for her compassion for her son was strong. She said, "O my lord, give her the living child, and do not kill him!" But the other said, "Let it be neither mine nor yours; divide it."
The king responded, "Give her the living child, and do not kill him; she is his mother."
All Israel heard of the judgment the king had rendered, and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice.
