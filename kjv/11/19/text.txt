And Ahab informed Jezebel of all that Elijah had accomplished, including how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow at this time."
When he saw this, he got up, fled for his life, and arrived at Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, leaving his servant there.
However, he himself traveled a day's journey into the wilderness, sat down under a juniper tree, and requested that he might die, saying, "It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."
As he lay and slept under the juniper tree, an angel touched him and said, "Arise and eat."
He looked, and there was a cake baked on the coals and a jar of water at his head. He ate and drank, then lay down again.
The angel of the LORD came again the second time, touched him, and said, "Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you."
He arose, ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.
He arrived at a cave and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, asking, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword; and I, even I alone, am left, and they seek my life to take it away."
The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD." Then the LORD passed by, and a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
After the earthquake came a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak, went out, and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice came to him, asking, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
He answered, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword; and I, even I alone, am left, and they seek my life to take it away."
The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael to be king over Aram.
Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet."
Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.
Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israelâ€”all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.
So he left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him.
Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you." Elijah replied, "Go back; what have I done to you?"
So Elisha returned to him, took a yoke of oxen, slaughtered them, boiled their flesh using the plow equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, becoming his servant.
