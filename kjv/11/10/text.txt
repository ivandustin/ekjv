And when the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame regarding the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions.  
She arrived in Jerusalem with a large entourage, including camels carrying spices, a significant amount of gold, and precious stones. When she met Solomon, she discussed everything that was on her mind.  
Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king that he did not reveal to her.  
After the queen of Sheba witnessed all of Solomon's wisdom and the magnificent house he had built,  
along with the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his officials, their attire, his cupbearers, and the way he ascended to the house of the LORD, she was left breathless.  
She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your deeds and wisdom was true.  
However, I did not believe the words until I came and saw it with my own eyes; indeed, the half was not told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the fame I had heard.  
Blessed are your men, blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom.  
Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel. Because the LORD loved Israel forever, He made you king to administer justice and righteousness."  
She presented the king with one hundred and twenty talents of gold, a large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never before had such an abundance of spices been brought as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.  
Hiram's navy, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought back a great quantity of almug trees and precious stones.  
The king used the almug trees to make pillars for the house of the LORD and for his own palace, as well as harps and lyres for the singers. To this day, no such almug trees have been seen.  
King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she desired, whatever she asked for, in addition to what he gave her from his royal bounty. Then she returned to her own country with her servants.  
The total weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,  
not including what he received from the merchants, the spice traders, and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land.  
King Solomon made two hundred gold shields, each requiring six hundred shekels of gold.  
He also made three hundred gold shields, each requiring three pounds of gold, and placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.  
Moreover, the king made a grand throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold.  
The throne had six steps, and the top was rounded at the back. There were armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.  
Twelve lions stood on each side of the six steps; nothing like it had been made in any kingdom.  
All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were made of gold, and all the vessels in the house of the forest of Lebanon were pure gold; silver was not valued in Solomon's days.  
For the king had a fleet of ships from Tarshish in partnership with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years, the Tarshish fleet returned, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.  
Thus, King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.  
All the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had placed in his heart.  
People brought gifts to him: vessels of silver, vessels of gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, each year according to their ability.  
Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.  
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as sycamore trees in the lowlands.  
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and linen yarn; the king's merchants acquired the linen yarn at a set price.  
A chariot from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred fifty shekels. They exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
