Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, along with the bishops and deacons:
Grace and peace be unto you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God every time I remember you,
Always making requests for all of you with joy in every prayer of mine,
For your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now;
Being confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.
It is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; since both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all share in my grace.
For God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Jesus Christ.
And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,
So that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.
Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
But I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel;
As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
And because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this, I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
For I
