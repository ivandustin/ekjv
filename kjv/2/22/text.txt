If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must restore five oxen for each ox and four sheep for each sheep.  
If a thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, no blood shall be shed for him.  
If the sun has risen upon him, blood shall be shed for him; he must make full restitution; if he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft.  
If the stolen item is found in his possession, whether it be an ox, donkey, or sheep, he must restore double.  
If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten by putting his beast to graze in another man's field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field and vineyard.  
If a fire breaks out and catches in thorns, consuming stacks of corn, standing corn, or the field, the one who kindled the fire must surely make restitution.  
If a man entrusts money or goods to his neighbor for safekeeping and they are stolen from the man's house, if the thief is found, he must pay double.  
If the thief is not found, the master of the house shall be brought before the judges to determine whether he has taken his neighbor's goods.  
For all types of trespass, whether for ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or any lost item claimed by another, both parties shall come before the judges; the one condemned by the judges must pay double to his neighbor.  
If a man entrusts his neighbor with an ox, donkey, sheep, or any beast to keep, and it dies, is hurt, or is driven away without anyone seeing it,  
Then an oath before the LORD shall be between them both, affirming that he has not taken his neighbor's goods; the owner shall accept this, and he shall not make restitution.  
If the animal is stolen from him, he must make restitution to the owner.  
If it is torn to pieces, he shall bring evidence of it, and he shall not be responsible for what was torn.  
If a man borrows anything from his neighbor and it is hurt or dies while the owner is not present, he must surely make restitution.  
But if the owner is with it, he shall not be responsible; if it is a hired item, it came for his hire.  
If a man seduces a maid who is not betrothed and lies with her, he must surely pay the bride price to make her his wife.  
If her father completely refuses to give her to him, he must pay money according to the dowry of virgins.  
You shall not allow a witch to live.  
Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.  
He who sacrifices to any god except the LORD alone shall be utterly destroyed.  
You shall neither mistreat a stranger nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.  
You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.  
If you afflict them in any way and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry;  
And my anger will be hot, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives shall become widows, and your children fatherless.  
If you lend money to any of my people who are poor, you shall not act as a creditor; you shall not charge him interest.  
If you take your neighbor's cloak as collateral, you must return it to him by sunset,  
For it is his only covering; it is the garment for his skin. What will he sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will hear, for I am gracious.  
You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.  
You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits and your liquors; you shall give me the firstborn of your sons.  
Likewise, you shall do with your oxen and sheep: it shall remain with its mother for seven days; on the eighth day, you shall give it to me.  
And you shall be holy men to me; you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.
