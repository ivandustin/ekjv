Here are the edited lines:
These are the names of the children of Israel who entered Egypt; each man and his household came with Jacob.
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
All the descendants that came from Jacob numbered seventy souls, for Joseph was already in Egypt.
Joseph died, along with all his brothers and that entire generation.
The children of Israel were fruitful, multiplied abundantly, and became exceedingly mighty; the land was filled with them.
A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
He said to his people, "Behold, the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we are.
Come, let us deal wisely with them; otherwise, they will multiply, and in the event of war, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the land."
So they appointed taskmasters over them to oppress them with burdens. They built treasure cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and grew. The Egyptians were distressed because of the children of Israel.
The Egyptians forced the children of Israel to work with harshness.
They made their lives bitter with hard labor, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the fields; all their labor was with rigor.
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah.
He said, "When you serve as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them giving birth on the stools; if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live."
However, the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded; they let the male children live.
The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this and let the male children live?"
The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."
Therefore, God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very mighty.
It came to pass that because the midwives feared God, He established households for them.
Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, but every daughter you shall save alive."
