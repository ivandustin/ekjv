And he said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance."
Moses alone shall approach the LORD; they must not come near, nor shall the people ascend with him.
Moses came and relayed all the words of the LORD and all the judgments to the people; they responded in unison, saying, "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do."
Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD, rose early in the morning, built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and erected twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
He sent young men from the children of Israel to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.
Moses took half of the blood and placed it in basins; the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
He took the book of the covenant and read it in the presence of the people; they replied, "All that the LORD has said we will do and be obedient."
Moses sprinkled the blood on the people, saying, "Behold the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words."
Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel ascended.
They beheld the God of Israel; beneath His feet was a pavement of sapphire stone, resembling the clear sky.
He did not lay a hand on the nobles of the children of Israel; they saw God and ate and drank.
The LORD said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and remain there; I will give you tablets of stone, along with a law and commandments that I have written, so you may teach them."
Moses rose up, along with his assistant Joshua, and ascended the mountain of God.
He instructed the elders, "Wait here for us until we return to you; Aaron and Hur are with you; if anyone has a matter to discuss, let him approach them."
Moses went up the mountain, and a cloud enveloped it.
The glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day, He called to Moses from within the cloud.
The appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop in the sight of the children of Israel.
Moses entered the cloud and ascended the mountain; he was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.
