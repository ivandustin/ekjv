Then Bezaleel and Aholiab, along with every skilled craftsman whom the LORD had endowed with wisdom and understanding, worked on all kinds of tasks for the service of the sanctuary, following all that the LORD had commanded.
Moses summoned Bezaleel and Aholiab, as well as every skilled craftsman whose heart the LORD had inspired, each one whose spirit was stirred to join in the work.
They received from Moses all the offerings that the children of Israel had brought for the service of the sanctuary, to carry out the work. They continued to bring him freewill offerings every morning.
All the skilled craftsmen who were engaged in the work of the sanctuary came, each one from the task they were working on.
They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people are bringing more than enough for the work of the service, which the LORD has commanded us to do."
Moses then commanded that it be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman make any more contributions for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing.
For the materials they had were sufficient for all the work to be done, and there was more than enough.
Every skilled craftsman among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains of finely twisted linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim skillfully embroidered into them.
The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain was four cubits; all the curtains were of the same size.
He joined five curtains together, and the other five curtains he joined together as well.
He made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain at the end of the joining, and likewise he made loops on the outer edge of another curtain at the joining of the second set.
He made fifty loops in one curtain, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was part of the second set; the loops held one curtain to another.
He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle became one.
He made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in total.
The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain was four cubits; the eleven curtains were all of the same size.
He joined five curtains together by themselves, and six curtains together by themselves.
He made fifty loops on the outer edge of the curtain in the joining, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was part of the second set.
He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together, so that it might be one.
He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.
He made boards for the tabernacle from acacia wood, standing upright.
The length of each board was ten cubits, and the width of each board was one and a half cubits.
Each board had two tenons, equally spaced; he made this for all the boards of the tabernacle.
He made twenty boards for the south side of the tabernacle.
He made forty silver sockets under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
For the other side of the tabernacle, which faces the north, he made twenty boards.
He made forty silver sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
For the west side of the tabernacle, he made six boards.
He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the two sides.
They were joined at the bottom and connected together at the top with one ring; he did this for both corners.
There were eight boards, and their sixteen silver sockets, with two sockets under each board.
He made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,
five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards on the west side of the tabernacle.
He made the middle bar to extend through the boards from one end to the other.
He overlaid the boards with gold, made their rings of gold to hold the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
He made a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with cherubim skillfully embroidered into it.
He made four pillars of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four silver sockets.

He made five pillars for it with their hooks, overlaid their capitals and bands with gold, but their five sockets were made of bronze.
