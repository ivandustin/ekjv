You shall construct an altar of acacia wood, measuring five cubits in length and five cubits in width; the altar shall be square, and its height shall be three cubits.  
You shall create horns for it at each of its four corners; the horns shall be of the same material, and you shall overlay it with bronze.  
You shall make pans to collect its ashes, along with shovels, basins, fleshhooks, and firepans; all these vessels shall be made of bronze.  
You shall create a grate of bronze mesh for it, and on the net, you shall attach four bronze rings at each of its four corners.  
You shall place it under the altar's ledge, so that the net is even with the middle of the altar.  
You shall make staves for the altar, using acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.  
The staves shall be inserted into the rings, and they shall be positioned on both sides of the altar to carry it.  
You shall construct it hollow with boards, as you were shown on the mountain; this is how they shall make it.  
You shall create the court of the tabernacle: for the south side, there shall be hangings of finely twisted linen, one hundred cubits long for that side.  
The twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.  
Similarly, for the north side, there shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, with twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.  
For the width of the court on the west side, there shall be hangings of fifty cubits, with ten pillars and ten sockets.  
The width of the court on the east side shall also be fifty cubits.  
The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three sockets.  
On the opposite side, there shall be hangings of fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three sockets.  
For the gate of the court, there shall be a hanging of twenty cubits, made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, crafted with needlework; and there shall be four pillars with four sockets.  
All the pillars surrounding the court shall be overlaid with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets shall be of bronze.  
The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, the width shall be fifty cubits everywhere, and the height shall be five cubits of finely twisted linen, with their sockets of bronze.  
All the vessels of the tabernacle for its service, along with all the pegs and pins for the court, shall be made of bronze.  
You shall instruct the children of Israel to bring you pure, beaten olive oil for the light, to ensure that the lamp burns continually.  
In the tabernacle of meeting, outside the veil that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend to it from evening until morning before the LORD; this shall be a lasting ordinance for their generations on behalf of the children of Israel.
