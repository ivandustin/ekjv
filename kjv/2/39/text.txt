And from the blue, purple, and scarlet, they crafted cloths for service in the holy place and made the sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD instructed Moses.  
He constructed the ephod using gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into wires to work with the blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, employing skilled craftsmanship.  
They created shoulder pieces for it to join it together; it was coupled at the two edges.  
The intricate girdle of his ephod, which was on it, was made of the same materials, according to its design: gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
They fashioned onyx stones set in gold settings, engraved like signets, with the names of the children of Israel.  
He placed them on the shoulders of the ephod to serve as memorial stones for the children of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
He made the breastplate with skilled craftsmanship, similar to the ephod, using gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
It was square; they made the breastplate double: a span was its length, and a span was its breadth, being doubled.  
They set four rows of stones in it: the first row contained a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle; this was the first row.  
The second row included an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  
The third row featured a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.  
The fourth row had a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were set in gold settings.  
The stones were named after the children of Israel, twelve in total, each engraved with his name, corresponding to the twelve tribes.  
They made chains for the breastplate at its ends, crafted from pure gold.  
They created two gold settings and two gold rings, placing the rings at the two ends of the breastplate.  
They attached the two gold chains to the rings at the ends of the breastplate.  
The ends of the two gold chains were fastened to the two settings and placed on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, in front of it.  
They made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the border that was on the side of the ephod inward.  
They made two additional gold rings and placed them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front, opposite the other coupling, above the intricate girdle of the ephod.  
They bound the breastplate to the rings of the ephod with a blue lace, ensuring it was above the intricate girdle of the ephod, so the breastplate would not be loosened from the ephod, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
He made the robe of the ephod from woven work, entirely blue.  
There was an opening in the center of the robe, like the opening of a coat of armor, with a band around the opening to prevent it from tearing.  
They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, and twined linen on the hems of the robe.  
They crafted bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe, all around between the pomegranates;  
A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
They made fine linen tunics for Aaron and his sons,  
And a mitre of fine linen, along with beautiful bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,  
And a girdle of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, crafted with needlework, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
They made the plate of the holy crown from pure gold and inscribed on it a writing, similar to the engravings of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD.  
They attached a blue lace to it, to fasten it high upon the mitre, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
Thus, all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed: and the children of Israel did everything the LORD commanded Moses, so they did.  
They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furnishings, including its clasps, boards, bars, pillars, and sockets,  
And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering,  
The ark of the testimony, its staves, and the mercy seat,  
The table and all its vessels, and the showbread,  
The pure lampstand with its lamps, arranged to be set in order, along with all its vessels and the oil for light,  
And the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,  
The bronze altar, its grate of bronze, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,  
The hangings of the court, its pillars, and sockets, the hanging for the court gate, its cords, pins, and all the vessels for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting,  
The cloths for service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister in the priest's office.  
According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel completed all the work.  
Moses inspected all the work, and behold, they had done it as the LORD commanded; they had completed it, and Moses blessed them.
