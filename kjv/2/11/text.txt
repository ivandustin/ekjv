And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and Egypt; after that, he will let you go. When he does, he will surely drive you out completely."
"Speak to the people and let every man ask his neighbor, and every woman her neighbor, for jewels of silver and jewels of gold."
The LORD granted the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Furthermore, Moses was highly regarded in the land of Egypt, both by Pharaoh's servants and by the people.
Moses declared, "Thus says the LORD: At midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt."
"All the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant grinding at the mill, and all the firstborn of the livestock."
"There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as has never been before and will never be again."
"But against any of the children of Israel, not a dog will bark, whether against man or beast, so that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel."
"All your servants will come down to me and bow before me, saying, 'Get out, you and all the people who follow you.' After that, I will leave." And he left Pharaoh's presence in great anger.
The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the children of Israel leave his land.
