And when the people noticed that Moses was taking longer to come down from the mountain, they gathered together to Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us gods to go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him."

Aaron replied to them, "Break off the golden earrings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."

All the people took off their golden earrings and brought them to Aaron.

He received them from their hands and fashioned a molten calf with a graving tool; then they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."

When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it and made a proclamation, saying, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD."

They rose early the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; the people sat down to eat and drink, and then rose up to play.

The LORD said to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.

They have quickly turned aside from the way I commanded them; they have made a molten calf, worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, saying, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"

The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.

Now, therefore, let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."

Moses pleaded with the LORD his God, saying, "LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?

Why should the Egyptians say, 'For evil did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce wrath and relent from this evil against your people.

Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, saying, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'"

The LORD relented from the disaster he had said he would bring upon his people.

Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand; the tablets were written on both sides; they were written on one side and the other.

The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.

When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."

Moses replied, "It is not the voice of those who shout for victory, nor is it the voice of those who cry out in defeat; but the sound of singing I hear."

As soon as he came near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing; Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.

He took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.

Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"

Aaron replied, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil.

For they said to me, 'Make us gods to go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'

I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them break it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."

When Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies),

Moses stood at the entrance of the camp and said, "Whoever is on the LORD's side, come to me." And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.

He said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Put every man his sword on his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill every man his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"

The children of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and about three thousand men fell that day.

Moses had said, "Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son and upon his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day."

The next day, Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."

Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin and have made for themselves gods of gold.

Yet now, if you will forgive their sin, forgive it; but if not, I pray, blot me out of your book which you have written."

The LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.

Now therefore, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; behold, my Angel shall go before you; nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."

The LORD plagued the people because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
