And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"See, I have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.  
I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of craftsmanship,  
to devise artistic works, to work with gold, silver, and bronze,  
and in cutting stones to set them, and in carving wood, to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.  
Moreover, I have given him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted, I have placed wisdom, so they may create all that I have commanded you:  
the tabernacle of the congregation, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is upon it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,  
the table and its furniture, the pure lampstand with all its accessories, and the altar of incense,  
the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin and its stand,  
the garments of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister in the priest's office,  
the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you, they shall do."  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Truly, my Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.  
You shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you: anyone who defiles it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.  
Six days may work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.  
Therefore, the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant.  
It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day, He rested and was refreshed.'  
And He gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, two tablets of testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God."
