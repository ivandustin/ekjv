And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to the children of Israel, instructing them to turn and camp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baalzephon; there shall you encamp by the sea.  
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, "They are trapped in the land; the wilderness has closed in on them."  
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did as instructed.  
It was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the hearts of Pharaoh and his servants turned against the people, and they said, "What have we done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"  
He prepared his chariot and took his people with him.  
He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over each one of them.  
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel, who went out with great boldness.  
But the Egyptians pursued them, with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them as they camped by the sea, near Pihahiroth, opposite Baalzephon.  
As Pharaoh approached, the children of Israel lifted their eyes and saw the Egyptians marching after them; they were terrified, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.  
They said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us this way, bringing us out of Egypt?"  
Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, "Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians"? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.  
Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; stand firm and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will show you today. For the Egyptians you see today, you shall never see again."  
The LORD will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.  
And the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward.  
But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the children of Israel may go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.  
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will follow them; and I will gain glory over Pharaoh, and over all his army, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.  
And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I have gained glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.  
And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before their face and stood behind them.  
It came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these, so that the one did not come near the other all night.  
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, making the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  
The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, with the waters as a wall on their right and on their left.  
The Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea, all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch, the LORD looked down upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.  
He took off their chariot wheels, causing them to drive heavily, so that the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians."  
And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."  
Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength at the break of dawn; and the Egyptians fled against it, and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  
The waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that had gone into the sea after them; not one of them remained.  
But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, with the waters as a wall on their right and on their left.  
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  
And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did against the Egyptians; and the people feared the LORD and believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses.
