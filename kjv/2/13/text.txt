And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast: it is mine."
And Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, when you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by the strength of His hand, the LORD brought you out from this place: no leavened bread shall be eaten."
This day you came out in the month of Abib.
And it shall be when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.
For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, nor shall any leaven be seen in all your quarters.
And you shall show your son on that day, saying, "This is done because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt."
And it shall be a sign to you on your hand, and a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand, the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
And it shall be when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,
That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the womb, and every firstling that comes from a beast that you have; the males shall be the LORD's.
And every firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children you shall redeem.
And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What is this?" that you shall say to him, "By the strength of His hand, the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was reluctant to let us go, that the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast: therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
And it shall be a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by the strength of His hand, the LORD brought us out of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt."
But God led the people around, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had sworn the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."
And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the edge of the wilderness.
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, to go by day and night.
He did not take away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
