And take Aaron, your brother, and his sons from among the children of Israel, so that he may serve as my priest, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
You shall make holy garments for Aaron, your brother, for glory and for beauty.  
Speak to all who are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, so they can create garments for Aaron to consecrate him, enabling him to serve as my priest.  
These are the garments they shall make: a breastplate, an ephod, a robe, a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle. They shall create holy garments for Aaron, your brother, and his sons, so he may serve as my priest.  
They shall use gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.  
The ephod shall be made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, crafted with skill.  
It shall have two shoulder pieces joined at the edges, ensuring it is securely fastened.  
The curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be made of the same materials, crafted with skill: gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
You shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the children of Israel:  
Six names on one stone and the other six names on the other stone, according to their birth order.  
With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel, and set them in gold ouches.  
You shall place the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod as memorial stones for the children of Israel; Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders as a memorial.  
You shall make ouches of gold;  
And two chains of pure gold at the ends; you shall make them of wreathen work and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.  
You shall make the breastplate of judgment with skill, following the design of the ephod; it shall be made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  
It shall be square and doubled; a span shall be its length and a span shall be its breadth.  
You shall set in it four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle; this shall be the first row.  
The second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  
The third row shall be a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.  
The fourth row shall be a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be set in gold in their settings.  
The stones shall bear the names of the children of Israel, twelve in total, according to their names, engraved like a signet; each shall have his name according to the twelve tribes.  
You shall make chains of wreathen work of pure gold for the breastplate at its ends.  
You shall make two rings of gold for the breastplate and place them on its two ends.  
You shall put the two wreathen chains of gold into the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.  
The other ends of the two wreathen chains shall be fastened to the two ouches and placed on the shoulder pieces of the ephod in front.  
You shall make two rings of gold and place them on the two ends of the breastplate at its border, which is on the side of the ephod inward.  
You shall make two other rings of gold and place them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front, opposite the other coupling, above the curious girdle of the ephod.  
They shall bind the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, so that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, ensuring the breastplate does not come loose from the ephod.  
Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment on his heart when he enters the holy place, as a memorial before the LORD continually.  
You shall place the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate of judgment; they shall be on Aaron's heart when he goes in before the LORD, and he shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.  
You shall make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue.  
There shall be a hole in the top of it, in the center; it shall have a binding of woven work around the hole, like the hole of a coat of armor, to prevent it from tearing.  
On the hem of it, you shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet, all around the hem, with golden bells between them:  
A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe.  
It shall be on Aaron to minister, and his sound shall be heard when he enters the holy place before the LORD and when he comes out, so that he does not die.  
You shall make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet, "HOLINESS TO THE LORD."  
You shall attach it to a blue lace, so that it may be on the mitre, on the forefront of the mitre.  
It shall be on Aaron's forehead, so that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things that the children of Israel hallow in all their holy gifts; it shall always be on his forehead, so that they may be accepted before the LORD.  
You shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and make the mitre of fine linen, and the girdle of needlework.  
For Aaron's sons, you shall make coats, girdles, and bonnets for them, for glory and for beauty.  
You shall put them on Aaron, your brother, and his sons with him; you shall anoint them, consecrate them, and sanctify them, so they may serve as my priests.  
You shall make linen breeches to cover their nakedness; they shall reach from the loins to the thighs.  
They shall be on Aaron and his sons when they enter the tabernacle of the congregation or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they do not bear iniquity and die; this shall be a permanent statute for him and his descendants after him.
