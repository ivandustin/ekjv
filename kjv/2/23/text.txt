You shall not raise a false report; do not join the wicked to be an unjust witness.  
You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; nor shall you speak in a case to pervert justice after many.  
You shall not show favoritism to a poor man in his cause.  
If you encounter your enemy's ox or donkey wandering, you must return it to him.  
If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying under its burden and refrain from helping, you must help him.  
You shall not pervert the judgment of your poor in their cause.  
Keep yourself far from false matters; do not slay the innocent and righteous, for I will not justify the wicked.  
You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the wise and distorts the words of the righteous.  
You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the heart of a stranger, having been strangers in the land of Egypt.  
For six years you shall sow your land and gather its produce.  
But in the seventh year, you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor of your people may eat, and what they leave, the beasts of the field shall eat. In the same way, you shall treat your vineyard and your olive grove.  
For six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day, you shall rest, so that your ox and donkey may rest, and the son of your maidservant and the stranger may be refreshed.  
In all that I have said to you, be careful; do not mention the name of other gods, nor let it be heard from your mouth.  
Three times a year, you shall celebrate a feast to me.  
You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; none shall appear before me empty-handed.  
And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field; and the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors from the field.  
Three times a year, all your males shall appear before the LORD God.  
You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until morning.  
The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.  
Behold, I send an Angel before you to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared.  
Beware of him and obey his voice; do not provoke him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him.  
But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.  
For my Angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will cut them off.  
You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices; you shall utterly overthrow them and break their images.  
You shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from your midst.  
None shall miscarry or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.  
I will send my terror before you and will throw into confusion all the people you encounter, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.  
I will send hornets before you to drive out the Hivite, Canaanite, and Hittite from before you.  
I will not drive them out before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against you.  
Little by little, I will drive them out before you until you have increased and possess the land.  
I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.  
You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.  
They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
