A man from the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.  
The woman conceived and bore a son; when she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.  
When she could no longer hide him, she made an ark of bulrushes, coated it with tar and pitch, placed the child inside, and set it among the reeds by the riverbank.  
His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.  
The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river, and her maidens walked along the riverbank; when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to retrieve it.  
Upon opening it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She felt compassion for him and said, "This is one of the Hebrew children."  
Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and find a Hebrew woman to nurse the child for you?"  
Pharaoh's daughter replied, "Go." So the girl went and called the child's mother.  
Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." The woman took the child and nursed him.  
As the child grew, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "Because I drew him out of the water."  
In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their burdens; he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.  
He looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  
The next day, he went out again, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow?"  
The man replied, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Moses was afraid and thought, "Surely this thing is known."  
When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.  
The priest of Midian had seven daughters; they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.  
Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, watering their flock.  
When they returned to their father Reuel, he asked, "How is it that you have come back so soon today?"  
They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; he even drew enough water for us and watered the flock."  
He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to have something to eat."  
Moses was content to stay with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah in marriage.  
She bore him a son, and he named him Gershom, saying, "I have been a stranger in a foreign land."  
Over time, the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned under their bondage; they cried out, and their cry rose up to God because of their bondage.  
God heard their groaning and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
God looked upon the children of Israel and had compassion for them.
