The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, during the reign of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
I will completely remove all things from the land, declares the LORD.
I will eliminate both man and beast; I will destroy the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks along with the wicked: I will cut off man from the land, declares the LORD.
I will also extend my hand against Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; I will remove the remnant of Baal from this place, along with the names of the Chemarims and the priests.
And those who worship the host of heaven on the rooftops; those who worship and swear by the LORD, as well as those who swear by Malcham;
And those who have turned back from the LORD; those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him.
Be silent in the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and has invited His guests.
And it will come to pass on the day of the LORD's sacrifice that I will punish the officials, the king's children, and all who are dressed in foreign attire.
On that same day, I will also punish all those who leap over the threshold, filling their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
And it will come to pass on that day, declares the LORD, that there will be a cry from the Fish Gate, a howling from the Second Quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all who carry silver are gone.
And it will come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men who are complacent, who say in their hearts, "The LORD will not do good, nor will He do evil."
Therefore, their goods will become plunder, and their houses a desolation: they will build houses but not live in them; they will plant vineyards but not drink the wine from them.
The great day of the LORD is near, it is near and hastens greatly; the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man will cry there bitterly.
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of devastation and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and against the high towers.
And I will bring distress upon men, and they will walk like blind men because they have sinned against the LORD; their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath; the whole land will be consumed by the fire of His jealousy, for He will make a swift end of all who dwell in the land.
