I urge, therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of gratitude be made for all people;  
For kings and all those in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty.  
This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior;  
Who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
For there is one God and one mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus;  
Who gave Himself as a ransom for all, to be proclaimed at the proper time.  
For this purpose, I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—(I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying)—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.  
Therefore, I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or doubt.  
In the same way, I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes;  
But with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.  
Let a woman learn in quietness and full submission.  
I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.  
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.  
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.  
Nevertheless, she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with propriety.
