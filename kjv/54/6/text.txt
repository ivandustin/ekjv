Let all servants who are under the yoke consider their masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine are not blasphemed.  
And those who have believing masters should not despise them because they are brothers; rather, they should serve them, as they are faithful and beloved, sharing in the benefits. Teach and encourage these things.  
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine that aligns with godliness,  
he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with questions and disputes over words, which lead to envy, strife, insults, and evil suspicions.  
These are the perverse arguments of men with corrupt minds, devoid of the truth, who believe that gain is godliness; from such, withdraw yourself.  
But godliness with contentment is great gain.  
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.  
And having food and clothing, let us be content with these.  
But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a trap, and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into destruction and perdition.  
For the love of money is the root of all evil; some, eager for it, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.  
But you, O man of God, flee from these things; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.  
Fight the good fight of faith, take hold of eternal life, to which you were called and have made a good confession before many witnesses.  
I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who made a good confession before Pontius Pilate;  
that you keep this commandment without spot, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
which He will show in His own time, who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords;  
who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honor and power everlasting. Amen.  
Instruct those who are rich in this world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy;  
that they do good, be rich in good works, ready to share, and willing to communicate;  
storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of eternal life.  
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care, avoiding irreverent and empty chatter, and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;  
for by professing it, some have strayed from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
