Do not rebuke an elder, but treat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers.  
The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.  
Honor widows who are truly widows.  
However, if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents, for this is good and acceptable before God.  
Now, she who is a true widow and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.  
But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.  
And these things command, so that they may be blameless.  
But if anyone does not provide for his own, especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.  
Do not let a widow be enrolled if she is under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man.  
Well reported for good works; if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints' feet, assisted those in distress, and diligently followed every good work.  
But refuse the younger widows; for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they wish to marry.  
They incur condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge.  
Moreover, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they should not.  
Therefore, I desire that the younger women marry, bear children, manage their homes, and give no opportunity for the adversary to speak reproachfully.  
For some have already turned aside after Satan.  
If any believing man or woman has widows, let them assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are truly widows.  
Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.  
For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain," and, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."  
Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.  
Those who continue in sin rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest may also fear.  
I charge you in the presence of God, and of Christ Jesus, and of the elect angels, to observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism.  
Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.  
Do not drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.  
Some people's sins are evident, going before them to judgment; but the sins of others follow after.  
Likewise, the good works of some are also evident, and those that are not cannot be hidden.
