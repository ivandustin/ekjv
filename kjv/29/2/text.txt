Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm on my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming, and it is near at hand.  
A day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the morning spreads upon the mountains; a great and mighty people; there has never been anything like it, nor will there be again for many generations.  
A fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns; the land is like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness; indeed, nothing will escape them.  
Their appearance is like that of horses, and like horsemen, so shall they run.  
Like the sound of chariots on the tops of mountains, they shall leap, like the sound of a flame of fire that consumes the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.  
Before them, the people will be in great pain; all faces will turn pale.  
They will run like mighty men; they will climb the wall like warriors; and each will march in his own way, and they will not break their ranks.  
No one will push another; they will each walk in his path; and when they fall upon the sword, they will not be wounded.  
They will run to and fro in the city; they will run upon the wall, they will climb up on the houses; they will enter in at the windows like a thief.  
The earth will quake before them; the heavens will tremble; the sun and the moon will be darkened, and the stars will withdraw their shining.  
And the LORD will utter His voice before His army; for His camp is very great; for He is strong who executes His word; for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can endure it?  
Therefore, also now, says the LORD, turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.  
And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God; for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and He relents from doing harm.  
Who knows if He will return and relent, and leave a blessing behind Him; even a grain offering and a drink offering to the LORD your God?  
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly.  
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those who nurse at the breast; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride from her closet.  
Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not give Your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them; why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?  
Then the LORD will be jealous for His land, and He will have pity on His people.  
Yes, the LORD will answer and say to His people, Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with them; and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.  
But I will remove far from you the northern army, and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, with its face toward the eastern sea, and its rear toward the western sea; and its stench will rise, and its foul odor will come up, because it has done great things.  
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD will do great things.  
Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are springing up; the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength.  
Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God; for He has given you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.  
And the threshing floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.  
And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.  
And you will eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; and my people will never be ashamed.  
And you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is no other; and my people will never be ashamed.  
And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.  
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.  
And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.  
The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.  
And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be delivered; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as the LORD has said, and among the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
