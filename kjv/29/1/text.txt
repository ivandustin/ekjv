The word of the LORD came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.  
Listen, you elders, and pay attention, all you inhabitants of the land. Has this occurred in your lifetime, or even in the days of your ancestors?  
Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children tell the next generation.  
What the palmerworm has left, the locust has eaten; what the locust has left, the cankerworm has eaten; and what the cankerworm has left, the caterpillar has eaten.  
Awake, you drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the new wine; for it has been taken away from your lips.  
For a nation has invaded my land, strong and without number, whose teeth are like the teeth of a lion, and its fangs are like those of a great lion.  
It has laid waste my vine and ruined my fig tree; it has stripped them bare and thrown them away; their branches are made white.  
Lament like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth.  
The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.  
The fields are devastated, the land mourns; for the grain is destroyed: the new wine has dried up, and the oil languishes.  
Be ashamed, O you farmers; wail, O you vinedressers, for the wheat and the barley; because the harvest of the field has perished.  
The vine has dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree, and the apple tree, all the trees of the field, are withered; for joy has withered away from the children of men.  
Gird yourselves and lament, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God; for the grain offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.  
Consecrate a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD,  
Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.  
Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?  
The seed is rotting under the clods, the granaries are in ruins, the barns are broken down; for the grain has withered.  
How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are confused because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.  
O LORD, to you I cry: for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.  
The beasts of the field also cry out to you; for the rivers of water are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
