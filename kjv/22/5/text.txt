I have come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh along with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.
I sleep, but my heart is awake: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is drenched with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off my coat; how can I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how can I defile them?
My beloved put his hand through the hole of the door, and my heart was stirred for him.
I rose up to open to my beloved; my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone: my soul failed when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
The watchmen who went about the city found me; they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am sick with love.
What is your beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you so charge us?
My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
His head is like the finest gold, his locks are bushy and black as a raven.
His eyes are like the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, like sweet flowers: his lips are like lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh.
His hands are like gold rings set with beryl: his belly is like bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
His legs are like pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth is most sweet: yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
