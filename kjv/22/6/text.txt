Where has your beloved gone, O fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned aside? Let us seek him with you.  
My beloved has gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and gather lilies.  
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.  
You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, fearsome as an army with banners.  
Turn your eyes away from me, for they have captivated me; your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.  
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that have come up from the washing, each one bearing twins, and not one is barren among them.  
Like a piece of pomegranate are your temples within your locks.  
There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and countless virgins.  
My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, the chosen one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her and blessed her; indeed, the queens and concubines praised her.  
Who is she that appears like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, and fearsome as an army with banners?  
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine had blossomed and the pomegranates had budded.  
Before I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of Amminadib.  
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may gaze upon you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As if it were the company of two armies.
