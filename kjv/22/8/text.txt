O, that you were like my brother, who nursed at my mother's breast! When I find you outside, I would kiss you; indeed, I would not be scorned.
I would lead you and bring you into my mother's house, where she would teach me: I would offer you spiced wine and the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand would be under my head, and his right hand would embrace me.
I urge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir up or awaken my love until he desires it.
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? I raised you under the apple tree; there your mother gave you birth; there she bore you.
Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm: for love is as strong as death; jealousy is as fierce as the grave: its flames are fiery, a most intense blaze.
Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it: if a man were to give all the substance of his house for love, it would be utterly despised.
We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
If she is a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers: in his eyes, I was as one who found favor.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he leased the vineyard to caretakers; each was to bring a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those who tend the fruit, two hundred.
You who dwell in the gardens, your companions listen for your voice: let me hear it.
Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
