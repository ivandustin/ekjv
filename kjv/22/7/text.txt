How lovely are your feet in shoes, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like precious jewels, crafted by the hands of a skilled artisan.  
Your navel is like a round goblet, never lacking in wine; your belly resembles a mound of wheat surrounded by lilies.  
Your two breasts are like two young twin deer.  
Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes are like the fish pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bathrabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon that looks toward Damascus.  
Your head is like Mount Carmel, and your hair is like royal purple; the king is captivated by your beauty.  
How lovely and delightful you are, O love!  
Your stature resembles a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.  
I said, I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its branches; your breasts will be like clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.  
And the roof of your mouth is like the finest wine for my beloved, flowing smoothly and awakening the lips of those who are asleep.  
I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.  
Come, my beloved, let us go out to the fields; let us rest in the villages.  
Let us rise early to the vineyards; let us see if the vines are in bloom, if the tender grapes have appeared, and if the pomegranates are blossoming; there I will give you my love.  
The mandrakes emit a sweet fragrance, and at our gates are all kinds of delightful fruits, both new and old, which I have stored up for you, O my beloved.
