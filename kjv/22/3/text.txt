By night, on my bed, I sought the one whom my soul loves; I searched for him, but I did not find him.  
I will rise now and wander through the city, in the streets and in the broad ways; I will seek the one whom my soul loves; I searched for him, but I did not find him.  
The watchmen who patrol the city found me; to them, I said, "Have you seen the one whom my soul loves?"  
I had only passed a little way from them when I found the one whom my soul loves; I held him and would not let him go until I brought him into my mother's house, into the chamber of her who conceived me.  
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the does of the field, that you do not stir up or awaken my love until he pleases.  
Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?  
Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; sixty valiant men surround it, from the valiant of Israel.  
All of them hold swords, skilled in battle; each man has his sword at his side because of fear in the night.  
King Solomon made himself a chariot from the wood of Lebanon.  
He made its pillars of silver, its base of gold, its covering of purple, and its interior paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem.  
Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the joy of his heart.
