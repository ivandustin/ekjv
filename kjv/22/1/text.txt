The Song of Songs, attributed to Solomon.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine.
Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, your name is like ointment poured forth; therefore, the virgins love you.
Draw me in; we will run after you. The king has brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in you; we will remember your love more than wine; the upright love you.
I am dark but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not look upon me because I am dark, for the sun has gazed upon me. My mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.
Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed your flock, where you make it rest at noon; for why should I be like one who turns aside by the flocks of your companions?
If you do not know, O fairest among women, go your way following the footsteps of the flock, and feed your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
I have compared you, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
Your cheeks are lovely with rows of jewels; your neck is adorned with chains of gold.
We will make you borders of gold with studs of silver.
While the king sits at his table, my spikenard sends forth its fragrance.
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me; he shall lie all night between my breasts.
My beloved is to me like a cluster of henna in the vineyards of Engedi.
Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have dove's eyes.
Behold, you are fair, my beloved; yes, pleasant; also, our bed is green.
The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters are fir.
