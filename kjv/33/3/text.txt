And I said, "Listen, I implore you, O leaders of Jacob, and you rulers of the house of Israel; is it not your duty to understand justice?
You who despise what is good and cherish what is evil; who strip the skin from their victims and tear the flesh from their bones;
Who consume the flesh of my people and skin them alive; they break their bones and chop them into pieces, like meat for the pot, and like flesh in a cauldron.
Then they will cry out to the LORD, but He will not listen to them; He will hide His face from them at that time, because of their wicked deeds.
Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and proclaim, 'Peace'; but those who do not put food in their mouths, they prepare for war against him.
Therefore, night will come upon you, and you will have no vision; it will be dark for you, and you will not be able to divine; the sun will set on the prophets, and the day will be dark for them.
Then the seers will be ashamed, and the diviners will be humiliated; indeed, they will all cover their mouths, for there is no response from God.
But truly, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and strength, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
Listen to this, I implore you, you leaders of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who detest justice and distort all that is right.
They build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with wickedness.
Its leaders judge for a bribe, its priests teach for a fee, and its prophets prophesy for money; yet they lean on the LORD and say, 'Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us.'
Therefore, for your sake, Zion will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house will be like the high places of a forest."
