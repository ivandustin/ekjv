The word of the LORD came to Micah the Morasthite during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.
Listen, all you people; pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it: let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, the LORD from His holy temple.
For behold, the LORD is coming out of His place; He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
The mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys will split open like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep slope.
This is all due to the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?
Therefore, I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the field, like the planting of a vineyard; I will pour its stones into the valley and uncover its foundations.
All its carved images will be shattered, and all its wages will be burned with fire; I will make all its idols desolate, for she collected them as a harlot's wages, and they will return to the wages of a harlot.
Therefore, I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a lamentation like the jackals and mourning like the ostriches.
For her wound is incurable; it has come to Judah; it has reached the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
Do not declare it in Gath; do not weep at all; in the house of Aphrah, roll in the dust.
Pass away, you inhabitant of Saphir, with your shame uncovered; the inhabitant of Zaanan did not come out in the mourning of Bethezel; he will receive from you his standing.
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good, but evil came down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
O inhabitant of Lachish, tie the chariot to the swift beast; she is the beginning of sin for the daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
Therefore, you shall give gifts to Moreshethgath; the houses of Achzib will be a deception to the kings of Israel.
Yet I will bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah; he shall come to Adullam, the glory of Israel.
Make yourself bald and shave for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness like the eagle, for they have gone into captivity from you.
