O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, reveal Yourself.  
Lift Yourself up, O Judge of the earth: grant a reward to the proud.  
LORD, how long will the wicked triumph? How long will the wicked prevail?  
How long will they speak harshly and boast? All the workers of iniquity take pride in their deeds.  
They shatter Your people, O LORD, and afflict Your heritage.  
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.  
Yet they say, "The LORD will not see; neither will the God of Jacob pay attention."  
Understand, you brutish among the people; and you fools, when will you be wise?  
He who planted the ear, will He not hear? He who formed the eye, will He not see?  
He who chastises the nations, will He not correct? He who teaches man knowledge, will He not know?  
The LORD knows the thoughts of man; they are but vanity.  
Blessed is the man whom You chasten, O LORD, and teach out of Your law;  
That You may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.  
For the LORD will not cast off His people, nor will He forsake His inheritance.  
But judgment will return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.  
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?  
Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul would have almost dwelt in silence.  
When I said, "My foot slips," Your mercy, O LORD, upheld me.  
In the multitude of my thoughts within me, Your comforts delight my soul.  
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with You, which frames mischief by a law?  
They gather against the soul of the righteous and condemn innocent blood.  
But the LORD is my defense; my God is the rock of my refuge.  
And He will bring upon them their own iniquity and cut them off in their own wickedness; yes, the LORD our God will cut them off.
