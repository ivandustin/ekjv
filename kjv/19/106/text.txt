Praise the LORD! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His mercy endures forever.  
Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD? Who can declare all His praise?  
Blessed are those who uphold justice and practice righteousness at all times.  
Remember me, O LORD, with the favor You show to Your people; visit me with Your salvation.  
That I may witness the goodness of Your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of Your nation, and glory in Your inheritance.  
We have sinned alongside our ancestors; we have committed iniquity and acted wickedly.  
Our ancestors did not comprehend Your wonders in Egypt; they forgot the multitude of Your mercies and provoked You at the sea, even at the Red Sea.  
Yet, for Your name's sake, You saved them, to make Your mighty power known.  
You rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; You led them through the depths as through a wilderness.  
You saved them from the hand of their enemies and redeemed them from their oppressors.  
The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them remained.  
Then they believed His words and sang His praise.  
But they soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel.  
Instead, they craved excessively in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.  
He granted their request but sent leanness into their souls.  
They envied Moses in the camp and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.  
The earth opened and swallowed Dathan, covering the company of Abiram.  
A fire ignited among them, and the flame consumed the wicked.  
They made a calf at Horeb and worshipped the molten image.  
Thus, they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass.  
They forgot God, their Savior, who had performed great deeds in Egypt;  
Wondrous works in the land of Ham and terrible things by the Red Sea.  
Therefore, He declared He would destroy them, had not Moses, His chosen one, stood before Him in the breach to turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them.  
Indeed, they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His word.  
Instead, they murmured in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.  
Therefore, He raised His hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness.  
To scatter their descendants among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.  
They joined themselves to Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead.  
Thus, they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.  
Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment; thus, the plague was halted.  
And that was credited to him as righteousness for all generations forever.  
They angered Him at the waters of strife, causing trouble for Moses because of them.  
They provoked His spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.  
They did not destroy the nations as the LORD commanded them.  
Instead, they mingled among the heathen and learned their ways.  
They served their idols, which became a snare to them.  
Indeed, they sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons,  
And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; thus, the land was polluted with blood.  
They defiled themselves with their own deeds and engaged in their own inventions.  
Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against His people, so much so that He abhorred His own inheritance.  
He gave them into the hands of the heathen, and those who hated them ruled over them.  
Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.  
Many times He delivered them, but they provoked Him with their counsel and were brought low because of their iniquity.  
Nevertheless, He regarded their affliction when He heard their cry.  
He remembered His covenant and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.  
He made them objects of pity to all who carried them captive.  
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and triumph in Your praise.  
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; let all the people say, Amen. Praise the LORD!
