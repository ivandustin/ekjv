By the rivers of Babylon, we sat down and wept as we remembered Zion.
We hung our harps on the willows in the midst of it.
For those who carried us away captive demanded a song from us; those who devastated us asked for joy, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
How can we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.
If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth; if I do not prioritize Jerusalem above my greatest joy.
Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom on the day of Jerusalem; they said, "Tear it down, tear it down, to its very foundation."
O daughter of Babylon, destined for destruction; blessed is the one who repays you for what you have done to us.
Blessed is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
