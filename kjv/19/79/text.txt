O God, the nations have entered into Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple and laid Jerusalem in ruins.
The lifeless bodies of Your servants have been given as food to the birds of the air, and the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
Their blood has been shed like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, a source of scorn and derision to those around us.
How long, LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that do not know You, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Your name.
For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste to his dwelling place.
O do not remember against us the iniquities of former times; let Your tender mercies come quickly to meet us, for we are brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name's sake.
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let Him be known among the nations in our sight by avenging the blood of Your servants that has been shed.
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power, preserve those who are destined to die.
And repay our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom for the reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
So we, Your people and the sheep of Your pasture, will give You thanks forever; we will proclaim Your praise to all generations.
