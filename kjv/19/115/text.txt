Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but to Your name we give glory, for Your mercy and for the sake of Your truth.
Why should the nations say, "Where is now their God?"
But our God is in the heavens; He has done whatever He has pleased.
Their idols are made of silver and gold, the work of human hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see.
They have ears, but they do not hear; they have noses, but they do not smell.
They have hands, but they do not handle; they have feet, but they do not walk; nor do they make a sound with their throats.
Those who make them are like them; so is everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust in the LORD; He is your help and your shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; He is your help and your shield.
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; He is your help and your shield.
The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great.
The LORD will increase you more and more, you and your children.
You are blessed of the LORD who made heaven and earth.
The heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to the children of men.
The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
