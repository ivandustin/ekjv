The LORD hears you in your time of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
May He send you help from His sanctuary and strengthen you from Zion.
May He remember all your offerings and accept your burnt sacrifices; Selah.
May He grant you according to your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God, we will raise our banners: may the LORD fulfill all your requests.
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will hear him from His holy heaven with the saving strength of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They are brought down and fallen; but we have risen and stand firm.
Save us, LORD: may the king hear us when we call.
