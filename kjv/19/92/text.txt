It is a wonderful thing to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High.  
To proclaim Your lovingkindness in the morning and Your faithfulness every night,  
With an instrument of ten strings, on the psaltery, and on the harp with a solemn sound.  
For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work; I will rejoice in the works of Your hands.  
O Lord, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very profound.  
A senseless man does not know; nor does a fool understand this.  
When the wicked flourish like grass, and all the workers of iniquity thrive, it is so that they shall be destroyed forever.  
But You, Lord, are most high forevermore.  
For behold, Your enemies, O Lord; indeed, Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  
But You shall exalt my horn like that of a wild ox; I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  
My eyes will also see my desire upon my enemies, and my ears will hear my desire concerning the wicked who rise up against me.  
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; they shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  
Those who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.  
They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and very green,  
To declare that the Lord is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
