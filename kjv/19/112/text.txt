Praise the LORD. Blessed is the person who fears the LORD and takes great delight in His commandments.  
Their offspring will be powerful on earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed.  
Wealth and riches will be found in their home, and their righteousness will endure forever.  
For the upright, light shines in the darkness; they are gracious, compassionate, and just.  
A good person shows favor and lends; they manage their affairs with wisdom.  
Surely, they will not be shaken forever; the righteous will be remembered eternally.  
They will not fear bad news; their heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.  
Their heart is secure; they will not be afraid until they see their desires fulfilled against their adversaries.  
They have distributed freely; they have given to the poor; their righteousness endures forever, and their reputation will be honored.  
The wicked will see this and be troubled; they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will come to nothing.
