Do you truly speak righteousness, O congregation? Do you judge justly, O sons of men?
Indeed, in your hearts, you practice wickedness; you measure the violence of your hands upon the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they stray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
Their poison is like that of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears.
She will not listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillfully they charm.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; shatter the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
Let them dissolve like waters that flow continually; when he bends his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be like shattered pieces.
Like a snail that melts away, let each of them vanish; like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, both the living and in His wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
So that a man will say, "Truly, there is a reward for the righteous; truly, He is a God who judges on the earth."
