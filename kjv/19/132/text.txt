Lord, remember David and all his hardships:  
How he swore to the LORD and made a vow to the mighty God of Jacob;  
Surely, I will not enter the tabernacle of my house or go up to my bed;  
I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,  
Until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the mighty God of Jacob.  
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the woods.  
We will go into His tabernacles; we will worship at His footstool.  
Arise, O LORD, into Your rest; You and the ark of Your strength.  
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints shout for joy.  
For the sake of Your servant David, do not turn away the face of Your anointed.  
The LORD has sworn in truth to David; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of your body, I will set upon your throne.  
If your children keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne forever.  
For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling.  
This is my rest forever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it.  
I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.  
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.  
There will I make the horn of David to bud; I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.  
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
