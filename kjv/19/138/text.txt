I will praise you with my whole heart; before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
I will worship toward your holy temple and praise your name for your lovingkindness and your truth, for you have magnified your word above all your name.
On the day I cried out, you answered me and strengthened me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.
Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD, for great is the glory of the LORD.
Though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly, but the proud he knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me; you will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand will save me.
The LORD will perfect that which concerns me; your mercy, O LORD, endures forever; do not forsake the works of your own hands.
