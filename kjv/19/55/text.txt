Listen to my prayer, O God; do not hide from my plea.  
Pay attention to me and hear me: I am distressed in my complaint and cry out.  
Because of the enemy's voice, due to the oppression of the wicked: they cast iniquity upon me and hate me with wrath.  
My heart is deeply pained within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.  
Fear and trembling have come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.  
And I said, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away and find rest.  
Indeed, I would wander far away and remain in the wilderness. Selah.  
I would hasten my escape from the raging storm and tempest.  
Destroy, O Lord, and confuse their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.  
Day and night they go around its walls: mischief and sorrow are in the midst of it.  
Wickedness is within it: deceit and guile do not depart from its streets.  
For it was not an enemy who reproached me; then I could have endured it: neither was it one who hated me that magnified himself against me; then I would have hidden from him.  
But it was you, a man my equal, my companion, and my close friend.  
We shared sweet counsel together and walked in the house of God in fellowship.  
Let death seize them, and let them go down alive into the grave: for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.  
As for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD will save me.  
Evening, morning, and noon, I will pray and cry out loud: and He will hear my voice.  
He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.  
God will hear and afflict them, even He who has been enthroned from of old. Selah. Because they do not change, they do not fear God.  
He has raised his hands against those who are at peace with him; he has broken his covenant.  
The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.  
Cast your burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain you: He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.  
But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in you.
