The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of islands be glad.
Clouds and darkness surround Him: righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goes before Him and consumes His enemies all around.
His lightning illuminates the world; the earth saw it and trembled.
The mountains melted like wax in the presence of the LORD, in the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim His righteousness, and all the people witness His glory.
Let all who serve graven images be confounded, those who boast of idols: worship Him, all you gods.
Zion heard and was glad; the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O LORD.
For You, LORD, are high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.
You who love the LORD, hate evil: He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
