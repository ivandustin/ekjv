Praise the LORD! O servants of the LORD, lift up His name in praise.  
Blessed be the name of the LORD, now and forevermore.  
From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of the LORD be praised.  
The LORD is exalted above all nations, and His glory surpasses the heavens.  
Who is like our God, the one who dwells on high?  
He humbles Himself to look upon the heavens and the earth!  
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap;  
To seat them with princes, even the princes of His people.  
He enables the barren woman to manage her household and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise the LORD!
