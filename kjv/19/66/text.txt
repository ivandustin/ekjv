Make a joyful noise to God, all you lands:  
Sing forth the honor of His name; make His praise glorious.  
Say to God, "How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power, Your enemies shall submit themselves to You."  
All the earth shall worship You and sing to You; they shall sing to Your name. Selah.  
Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His dealings with the children of men.  
He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the flood on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.  
He rules by His power forever; His eyes observe the nations; let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.  
O bless our God, you people, and let the voice of His praise be heard:  
He who holds our soul in life and does not allow our feet to be moved.  
For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined.  
You brought us into the net; You laid affliction upon our backs.  
You caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water, but You brought us out into a wealthy place.  
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows,  
Which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.  
I will offer to You burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.  
Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul.  
I cried to Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue.  
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me;  
But truly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.  
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
