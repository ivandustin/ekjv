O sing unto the LORD a fresh song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.  
Sing unto the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation day by day.  
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.  
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be revered above all gods.  
For all the gods of the nations are mere idols; but the LORD created the heavens.  
Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty dwell in His sanctuary.  
Give unto the LORD, O you families of the people; give unto the LORD glory and strength.  
Give unto the LORD the glory due to His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.  
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.  
Proclaim among the nations that the LORD reigns; the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity.  
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and all that fills it.  
Let the fields be joyful, and all that is in them; then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy.  
Before the LORD, for He comes; He comes to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.
