Listen to my words, O LORD; consider my thoughts.
Pay attention to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I will pray.
In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; in the morning I will direct my prayer to You and look up.
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; evil cannot dwell with You.
The foolish cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all who do iniquity.
You will destroy those who speak falsehood; the LORD detests the violent and deceitful person.
But as for me, I will enter Your house in the abundance of Your mercy; in reverence, I will worship toward Your holy temple.
Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make Your way straight before me.
For there is no faithfulness in their words; their hearts are full of wickedness; their throats are open graves; they flatter with their tongues.
Destroy them, O God; let them fall by their own plans; cast them out because of their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy, for You defend them; let those who love Your name be joyful in You.
For You, LORD, will bless the righteous; with Your favor, You will surround them like a shield.
