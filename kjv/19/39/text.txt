I said I would pay attention to my actions, so I do not sin with my words; I will keep my mouth restrained while the wicked are before me.
I remained silent, holding my peace even regarding good things; my sorrow stirred within me.
My heart burned within me as I pondered; the fire ignited, and then I spoke with my mouth.
LORD, help me understand my end and the measure of my days, so that I may realize how fragile I am.
Behold, you have made my days as brief as a handbreadth; my lifespan is nothing before you: truly, every person at their best is mere vanity. Selah.
Surely, every person walks in a vain show; they are troubled for nothing: they accumulate wealth but do not know who will gather it.
And now, Lord, what am I waiting for? My hope is in you.
Rescue me from all my transgressions; do not let me become a reproach to the foolish.
I was silent; I did not open my mouth because you did it.
Remove your hand from me; I am overwhelmed by the weight of your discipline.
When you correct a person for iniquity, you cause their beauty to fade away like a moth; surely, every person is vanity. Selah.
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and listen to my cry; do not remain silent at my tears, for I am a stranger with you, a sojourner, just as all my ancestors were.
O spare me, that I may regain my strength before I depart and am no more.
