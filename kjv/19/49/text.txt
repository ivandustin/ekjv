Listen closely, all you people; pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth:  
Both the lowly and the mighty, the rich and the poor, united together.  
My mouth will speak wisdom; the thoughts of my heart will reflect understanding.  
I will turn my ear to a parable; I will reveal my hidden insights through the harp.  
Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the sins of my past surround me?  
Those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches;  
None can redeem a brother or offer God a ransom for him:  
(For the redemption of their soul is precious and lasts forever:)  
That he may live eternally and not see decay.  
For he sees that wise men die, just as the foolish and senseless perish, leaving their wealth to others.  
Their inner thoughts are that their homes will last forever, and their dwellings for all generations; they name their lands after themselves.  
Yet man, despite his honor, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish.  
This is their folly, yet their descendants approve of their words. Selah.  
Like sheep, they are laid in the grave; death will consume them; the righteous will have dominion over them in the morning, and their splendor will fade in the grave from their dwelling.  
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for He will receive me. Selah.  
Do not be afraid when someone becomes wealthy, when the glory of their house increases;  
For when they die, they will take nothing with them; their glory will not follow them.  
Though they lived well and blessed themselves, people will praise you when you do well for yourself.  
They will join the generation of their ancestors; they will never see the light.  
A man who is honored but lacks understanding is like the beasts that perish.
