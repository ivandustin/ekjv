Plead my case, O LORD, with those who contend against me: fight against those who fight against me.
Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to assist me.
Draw out the spear, and block the path of those who persecute me: tell my soul, I am your salvation.
Let those who seek my life be confounded and shamed: let them turn back and be brought to confusion who plot my harm.
Let them be like chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD pursue them.
Let their path be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.
For without cause they have hidden a net for me in a pit, which they have dug without reason for my soul.
Let destruction come upon him unexpectedly; and let his net that he has concealed ensnare him: into that very destruction let him fall.
And my soul shall rejoice in the LORD: it shall exult in his salvation.
All my bones shall declare, LORD, who is like you, who rescues the poor from those too strong for them, yes, the poor and the needy from those who exploit them?
False witnesses rose up against me; they accused me of things I did not know.
They repaid me evil for good, to the ruin of my soul.
But as for me, when they were ill, I wore sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned to my own heart.
I acted as if he were my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, like one who mourns for his mother.
But in my adversity, they rejoiced and gathered together: yes, the lowly gathered against me, and I was unaware; they tore me and did not stop.
With hypocritical mockers at feasts, they gnashed their teeth at me.
Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my soul from their destruction, my precious one from the lions.
I will give you thanks in the great congregation: I will praise you among many people.
Let not those who are my enemies unjustly rejoice over me: nor let them wink with the eye who hate me without cause.
For they do not speak peace: but they devise deceitful schemes against those who are quiet in the land.
Yes, they opened their mouths wide against me, and said, Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it.
This you have seen, O LORD: do not remain silent: O Lord, do not be far from me.
Stir up yourself, and awaken to my judgment, even to my cause, my God and my Lord.
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to your righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so we would have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together who rejoice at my misfortune: let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who exalt themselves against me.
Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause: yes, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, who takes pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
And my tongue shall speak of your righteousness and of your praise all day long.
