Judge me, O God, and advocate for me against a wicked nation: O rescue me from the deceitful and unjust individual.  
For You are the God of my strength: why do You reject me? Why do I mourn because of the oppression from my adversary?  
O send forth Your light and Your truth: let them guide me; let them bring me to Your holy mountain and to Your dwelling places.  
Then I will approach the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy: yes, I will praise You on the harp, O God my God.  
Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you troubled within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.
