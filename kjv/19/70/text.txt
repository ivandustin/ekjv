Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.  
Let those who seek my soul be ashamed and confounded; let them be turned backward and put to confusion, those who desire my hurt.  
Let them be turned back as a reward for their shame, who say, "Aha, aha."  
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified."  
But I am poor and needy; make haste to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay.
