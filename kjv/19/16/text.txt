Preserve me, O God, for in You I place my trust.
O my soul, you have declared to the LORD, "You are my Lord; my goodness does not extend to You."
But to the saints who are in the land, and to the noble ones, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows will be multiplied who chase after another god; I will not offer their drink offerings of blood, nor will I speak their names with my lips.
The LORD is my portion and my cup; You uphold my lot.
The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel; my heart also instructs me in the night.
I have set the LORD always before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my spirit rejoices; my body also will rest in hope.
For You will not abandon my soul to the grave, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see decay.
You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
