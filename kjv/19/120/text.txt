In my anguish, I called out to the LORD, and He listened to me.
Rescue my soul, O LORD, from deceitful lips and a treacherous tongue.
What will be given to you? Or what will be done to you, O deceitful tongue?
Piercing arrows from the mighty, along with burning coals of juniper.
Alas, I find myself in Mesech, and I reside among the tents of Kedar!
My soul has long been in the company of those who despise peace.
I seek peace; yet when I speak, they are ready for conflict.
