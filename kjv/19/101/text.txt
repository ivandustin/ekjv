I will sing of mercy and judgment; to You, O LORD, I will sing.  
I will conduct myself wisely in a perfect manner. O when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a sincere heart.  
I will place no wicked thing before my eyes; I detest the actions of those who turn away; they shall not cling to me.  
A deceitful heart shall depart from me; I will not associate with a wicked person.  
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will cut off; I will not tolerate him who has a haughty look and a proud heart.  
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me.  
He who practices deceit shall not reside in my house; he who tells lies shall not remain in my sight.  
I will early eliminate all the wicked from the land, so that I may cut off all wrongdoers from the city of the LORD.
