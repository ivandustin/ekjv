In Judah, God is known; His name is great in Israel.  
In Salem, His tabernacle stands, and His dwelling place is in Zion.  
There, He shattered the arrows of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Selah.  
You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.  
The stouthearted have been defeated; they have fallen into a deep sleep, and none of the mighty men have found their strength.  
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are plunged into a deep slumber.  
You alone are to be feared; who can stand in Your presence when You are angry?  
You caused judgment to be proclaimed from heaven; the earth trembled and was still,  
When God arose to judge, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.  
Surely, the wrath of man will praise You; the remainder of wrath You will restrain.  
Make vows and fulfill them to the LORD your God; let all those around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.  
He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
