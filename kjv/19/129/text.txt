Many times have they afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now declare:  
Many times have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not triumphed over me.  
The plowers have plowed upon my back, making long their furrows.  
The LORD is righteous; He has severed the cords of the wicked.  
Let all who hate Zion be confounded and turned back.  
Let them be like the grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow.  
With which the mower fills not his hand, nor does he who binds sheaves fill his bosom.  
Neither do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."
