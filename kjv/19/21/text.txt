The king shall rejoice in your strength, O LORD; and in your salvation, how greatly he shall celebrate!  
You have granted him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.  
For you go before him with the blessings of goodness; you place a crown of pure gold upon his head.  
He asked for life from you, and you granted it to him, even length of days forever and ever.  
His glory is great in your salvation; honor and majesty you have bestowed upon him.  
For you have made him most blessed forever; you have filled him with joy in your presence.  
For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the mercy of the Most High, he shall not be shaken.  
Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will discover those who hate you.  
You will make them like a fiery oven in the time of your anger; the LORD will consume them in his wrath, and the fire will devour them.  
You will destroy their offspring from the earth and their descendants from among the children of men.  
For they plotted evil against you; they devised a wicked scheme that they cannot carry out.  
Therefore, you will make them turn their backs when you prepare your arrows upon your strings against them.  
Be exalted, LORD, in your own strength; so we will sing and praise your power.
