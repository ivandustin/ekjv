Save me, O God, by Your name, and judge me by Your strength.  
Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.  
For strangers have risen up against me, and oppressors seek my soul; they do not set God before them. Selah.  
Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is with those who support my soul.  
He will repay evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.  
I will willingly sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good.  
For He has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has seen His desire upon my enemies.
