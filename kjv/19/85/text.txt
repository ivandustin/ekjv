Lord, You have shown favor to Your land; You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.  
You have forgiven the iniquities of Your people; You have covered all their sins. Selah.  
You have removed all Your wrath; You have turned away from the fierceness of Your anger.  
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and let Your anger toward us cease.  
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?  
Will You not revive us again, so that Your people may rejoice in You?  
Show us Your mercy, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.  
I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will speak peace to His people and to His saints; but let them not return to folly.  
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.  
Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have embraced each other.  
Truth will spring forth from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven.  
Indeed, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase.  
Righteousness will go before Him and will prepare the way for His steps.
