I lift my eyes to you, O you who dwell in the heavens.
Just as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maid look to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look to the LORD our God, until He shows us mercy.
Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us: for we are overwhelmed with contempt.
Our souls are deeply filled with the scorn of those who are at ease, and with the disdain of the proud.
