As the deer longs for the water brooks, so my soul longs for You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when will I come and stand before God?
My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, "Where is your God?"
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me: for I used to go with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with a voice of joy and praise, with a throng that celebrated the feast.
Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the help of His presence.
O my God, my soul is downcast within me: therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, and from the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.
Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and billows have swept over me.
Yet the LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night His song will be with me, and my prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
As with a sword in my bones, my enemies taunt me; while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.
