Be merciful to me, O God, for man seeks to consume me; he fights against me daily and oppresses me.
My enemies seek to devour me every day; there are many who wage war against me, O Most High.
Whenever I am afraid, I will place my trust in you.
In God, I will praise His word; in God, I have placed my trust; I will not fear what mere mortals can do to me.
Every day, they twist my words; all their thoughts are aimed at my destruction.
They conspire together, hiding in wait, marking my steps as they seek my life.
Will they escape through their wickedness? In your anger, cast down the nations, O God.
You record my wanderings; put my tears in your bottle; are they not in your book?
When I cry out to you, my enemies will turn back; this I know, for God is on my side.
In God, I will praise His word; in the LORD, I will praise His word.
In God, I have placed my trust; I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.
Your vows are upon me, O God; I will offer you my praises.
For you have rescued my soul from death; will you not also keep my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
