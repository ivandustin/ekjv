The heavens proclaim the glory of God; the skies display His craftsmanship.
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
Their message has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In them, He has pitched a tent for the sun,
Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices like a strong man eager to run a race.
His rising is from one end of the heavens, and His circuit to the other end: and nothing is hidden from its heat.
The law of the LORD is flawless, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the simple wise.
The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the command of the LORD is radiant, giving light to the eyes.
The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the LORD are true and altogether righteous.
They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.
By them, your servant is warned; in keeping them, there is great reward.
Who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults.
Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me: then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
