I cried out to the LORD with my voice; with my voice, I made my supplication to the LORD.
I poured out my complaints before Him; I revealed my troubles to Him.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew my path. In the way I walked, they secretly laid a snare for me.
I looked to my right, but there was no one who recognized me; refuge failed me; no one cared for my soul.
I cried out to You, O LORD: I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
Listen to my cry; for I am very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Your name: the righteous will surround me; for You will deal bountifully with me.
