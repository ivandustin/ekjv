O LORD my God, in You I place my trust: rescue me from all who persecute me, and deliver me.  
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, ripping it to shreds, with no one to save me.  
O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands;  
If I have repaid evil to one who was at peace with me; (indeed, I have delivered him who is my enemy without cause:)  
Let the enemy pursue my soul and seize it; yes, let him trample my life to the ground and cast my honor into the dust. Selah.  
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; lift Yourself up because of the fury of my enemies: and awaken for me to the judgment You have commanded.  
So shall the congregation of the people surround You: for their sake, therefore, return on high.  
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is within me.  
Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God tests the hearts and minds.  
My defense is from God, who saves the upright in heart.  
God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.  
If he does not turn, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent his bow and made it ready.  
He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.  
Behold, he is in labor with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.  
He dug a pit and hollowed it out, and has fallen into the ditch he made.  
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent deeds shall come down upon his own crown.  
I will praise the LORD for His righteousness: and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
