I love the LORD because He has heard my voice and my pleas for help.
Since He has inclined His ear to me, I will call upon Him for as long as I live.
The sorrows of death surrounded me, and the pains of despair gripped me; I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called on the name of the LORD; O LORD, I implore You, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; indeed, our God is merciful.
The LORD protects the simple; I was brought low, and He helped me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has dealt generously with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I have spoken: I was greatly afflicted.
I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
What shall I give to the LORD for all His benefits toward me?
I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the LORD.
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.
O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of Your maidservant: You have freed my bonds.
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the LORD.
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all His people.
In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
