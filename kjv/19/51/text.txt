Have mercy on me, O God, according to your lovingkindness; according to the abundance of your tender mercies, erase my transgressions.  
Thoroughly wash me from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.  
For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.  
Against you, and you alone, have I sinned and committed this evil in your sight; so that you may be justified when you speak and blameless when you judge.  
Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.  
Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts; in the hidden part, teach me wisdom.  
Purge me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.  
Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have broken rejoice.  
Hide your face from my sins and erase all my iniquities.  
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.  
Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your holy spirit from me.  
Restore to me the joy of your salvation and uphold me with your generous spirit.  
Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will be converted to you.  
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.  
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.  
For you do not desire sacrifice; otherwise, I would give it; you do not delight in burnt offerings.  
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.  
Do good in your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.  
Then you will be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then they will offer bulls on your altar.
