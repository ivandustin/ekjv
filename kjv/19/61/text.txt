Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.  
From the ends of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed: guide me to the rock that is higher than I.  
For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower against the foe.  
I will dwell in your sanctuary forever: I will trust in the shadow of your wings. Selah.  
For you, O God, have heard my vows: you have granted me the inheritance of those who revere your name.  
You will extend the king's life: his years will endure for many generations.  
He shall dwell before God forever: O prepare mercy and truth to preserve him.  
So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows each day.
