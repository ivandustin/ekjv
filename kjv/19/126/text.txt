When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
Then our mouths were filled with laughter, and our tongues with singing; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.
Restore our fortunes again, O LORD, like the streams in the Negev.
Those who sow in tears will reap with joy.
He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
