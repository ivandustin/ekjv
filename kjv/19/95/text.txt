O come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.  
Let us approach His presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise to Him with psalms.  
For the LORD is a great God and a mighty King above all gods.  
In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is also His.  
The sea is His, and He made it; His hands formed the dry land.  
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.  
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice,  
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.  
When your fathers tested Me, proved Me, and saw My work.  
For forty years, I was grieved with this generation and said, "It is a people that err in their hearts, and they have not known My ways."  
To whom I swore in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest.
