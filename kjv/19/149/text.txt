Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, and offer His praise in the assembly of the faithful.
Let Israel rejoice in their Creator; let the children of Zion be glad in their King.
Let them praise His name with dance; let them sing praises to Him with tambourine and harp.
For the LORD delights in His people; He will adorn the humble with salvation.
Let the saints rejoice in glory; let them sing joyfully upon their beds.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To carry out vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with shackles of iron;
To carry out the judgment that is written: this honor belongs to all His saints. Praise the LORD!
