I cried out to God with my voice, even to God with my voice; and He listened to me.  
In my time of trouble, I sought the Lord: my pain persisted through the night and did not cease; my soul refused to be comforted.  
I remembered God and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.  
You keep my eyes awake; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.  
I have reflected on the days of old, the years of ancient times.  
I recall my song in the night; I commune with my own heart, and my spirit makes a diligent search.  
Will the Lord reject forever? Will He show no more favor?  
Is His mercy completely gone forever? Does His promise fail for all time?  
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger closed up His tender mercies? Selah.  
And I said, This is my weakness; but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.  
I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.  
I will also meditate on all Your work and speak of Your deeds.  
Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary; who is as great a God as our God?  
You are the God who performs wonders; You have declared Your strength among the people.  
You have redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph, with Your mighty arm. Selah.  
The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and were afraid; the depths were also troubled.  
The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth a sound; Your arrows also flew abroad.  
The voice of Your thunder was in the heavens; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.  
Your way is in the sea, and Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps are not known.  
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
