Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the person to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I remained silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all day long.
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up like the drought of summer. Selah.
I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this, let every godly person pray to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the floods of great waters, they shall not come near him.
You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble; you will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with my eye.
Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding; whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle, or they will not come near you.
Many sorrows shall come to the wicked, but he who trusts in the LORD, mercy shall surround him.
Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
