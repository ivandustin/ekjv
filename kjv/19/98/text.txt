O sing unto the LORD a fresh song; for He has accomplished marvelous deeds: His right hand and His holy arm have secured victory for Him.
The LORD has revealed His salvation: His righteousness He has openly displayed in the sight of the nations.
He has remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have witnessed the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: raise a loud sound, rejoice, and sing praises.
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and the sound of the cornet, make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together
Before the LORD; for He comes to judge the earth: with righteousness shall He judge the world and the people with equity.
