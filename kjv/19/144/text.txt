Blessed be the LORD, my strength, who teaches my hands to battle and my fingers to fight.  
My goodness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and the one in whom I trust; who subdues my people under me.  
LORD, what is man that you take notice of him? Or the son of man that you account for him?  
Man is like a breath; his days are like a shadow that passes away.  
Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, and they will smoke.  
Send forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out your arrows and destroy them.  
Send your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me from great waters, from the hands of foreign children.  
Whose mouths speak deceit, and their right hand is a hand of falsehood.  
I will sing a new song to you, O God; on a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings, I will sing praises to you.  
It is He who gives salvation to kings; who delivers David, His servant, from the harmful sword.  
Rescue me and deliver me from the hands of foreign children, whose mouths speak deceit, and whose right hand is a hand of falsehood.  
That our sons may be like plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be like cornerstones, polished like those of a palace.  
That our granaries may be full, providing all kinds of produce; that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.  
That our oxen may be strong for labor; that there be no breach or going out; that there be no outcry in our streets.  
Blessed is that people who is in such a state; yes, blessed is that people whose God is the LORD.
