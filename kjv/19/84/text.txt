How delightful are your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!
My soul longs, indeed, even faints for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Indeed, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in your house: they will continually praise you. Selah.
Blessed is the person whose strength is in you; in whose heart are the paths of those who seek you.
As they pass through the valley of Baca, they make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.
They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion.
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of your anointed.
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the person who trusts in you.
