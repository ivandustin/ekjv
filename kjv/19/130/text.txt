From the depths, I cry out to you, O LORD.  
Lord, hear my voice; let your ears be attentive to my pleas.  
If you, LORD, were to keep a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?  
Yet with you, there is forgiveness, so that you may be revered.  
I wait for the LORD; my soul waits, and in his word I place my hope.  
My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning; I say, more than watchmen long for the morning.  
Let Israel put their hope in the LORD, for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is abundant redemption.  
And he will redeem Israel from all his sins.
