Lord, how they have multiplied who trouble me! Many rise up against me.
Many say of my soul, "There is no help for him in God." Selah.
But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the one who lifts my head.
I cried out to the LORD with my voice, and He heard me from His holy hill. Selah.
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustained me.
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God, for you have struck all my enemies on the jaw; you have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing is upon your people. Selah.
