O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; do not discipline me in your fierce wrath.  
For your arrows have struck deep within me, and your hand weighs heavily upon me.  
There is no health in my body because of your anger; there is no peace in my bones due to my sin.  
My transgressions have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy for me to bear.  
My wounds are festering and infected because of my foolishness.  
I am distressed; I am deeply bowed down; I mourn all day long.  
My back is filled with a painful affliction, and there is no health in my body.  
I am weak and crushed; I have groaned because of the turmoil in my heart.  
Lord, all my desires are known to you; my sighing is not hidden from you.  
My heart races, my strength fails me; the light of my eyes has also gone from me.  
My loved ones and friends stand far away from my affliction; my relatives keep their distance.  
Those who seek my life lay traps for me; those who wish me harm speak malicious words and plot deceit all day long.  
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; I am like a mute who cannot speak.  
I am like a man who cannot hear, and in whose mouth are no arguments.  
For in you, O LORD, I put my hope; you will answer, O Lord my God.  
I said, "Hear me, lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slips, they will boast against me."  
For I am about to stumble, and my sorrow is ever before me.  
I will confess my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.  
But my enemies are alive and strong; those who hate me unjustly have increased in number.  
Those who repay good with evil are my adversaries; because I pursue what is good.  
Do not forsake me, O LORD; my God, do not be far from me.  
Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
