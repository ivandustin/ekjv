Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD and walks in His ways.
For you shall enjoy the fruits of your labor; you will be happy, and it will go well with you.
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your home; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.
Behold, this is how the man will be blessed who fears the LORD.
The LORD will bless you from Zion, and you will see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Indeed, you will see your children's children, and peace will be upon Israel.
