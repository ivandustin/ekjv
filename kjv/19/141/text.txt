Lord, I cry out to You: hurry to me; listen to my voice when I call upon You.  
Let my prayer rise before You like incense; and the lifting of my hands like the evening sacrifice.  
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.  
Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing, to engage in wicked deeds with those who do iniquity; and do not let me partake of their delicacies.  
Let the righteous strike me; it will be a kindness; and let him correct me; it will be like precious oil, which will not break my head; for my prayer will still be against their wickedness.  
When their judges are thrown down in rocky places, they will hear my words; for they are sweet.  
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, like when one cuts and splits wood on the ground.  
But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord; in You is my trust; do not leave my soul destitute.  
Keep me from the traps they have set for me, and from the snares of those who do evil.  
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.
