Why do you boast in your wickedness, O mighty man? The goodness of God endures forever.  
The tongue plots evil like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.  
You love evil more than good, and lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.  
You delight in destructive words, O deceitful tongue.  
God will destroy you forever; He will remove you, uproot you from your dwelling, and cast you out of the land of the living. Selah.  
The righteous will see this, fear, and laugh at you:  
"Look at the man who did not make God his strength, but trusted in his wealth and found strength in his wickedness."  
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.  
I will praise you forever, for you have done it; I will wait on your name, for it is good in the presence of your saints.
