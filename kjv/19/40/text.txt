I waited patiently for the LORD; He inclined to me and heard my cry.
He lifted me out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, establishing my steps.
He has put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God: many will see it, fear, and trust in the LORD.
Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not respect the proud or those who turn aside to lies.
Many, O LORD my God, are your wonderful works that you have done, and your thoughts toward us: they cannot be counted in order before you; if I were to declare and speak of them, they would be more than can be numbered.
You did not desire sacrifice and offering; you have opened my ears: burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
Then I said, "Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written about me."
I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.
I have proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, O LORD, you know.
I have not hidden your righteousness in my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation: I have not concealed your lovingkindness and your truth from the great congregation.
Do not withhold your tender mercies from me, O LORD; let your lovingkindness and your truth continually preserve me.
For countless evils have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I cannot look up; they are more than the hairs of my head; therefore, my heart fails me.
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.
Let those who seek to destroy my soul be ashamed and confounded together; let them be driven backward and put to shame who wish me evil.
Let them be desolate as a reward for their shame who say to me, "Aha, aha."
Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation say continually, "The LORD be magnified."
But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinks upon me: you are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God.
