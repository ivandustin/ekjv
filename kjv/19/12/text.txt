Help, LORD; for the godly man has ceased to exist; the faithful have vanished from among the children of men.  
They all speak emptiness with their neighbors; with flattering lips and a double heart, they communicate.  
The LORD will cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks arrogantly.  
They have said, "With our tongue, we will prevail; our lips are our own: who is our master?"  
For the oppression of the poor and the sighing of the needy, now I will arise, says the LORD; I will ensure their safety from those who mock them.  
The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.  
You will keep them, O LORD; you will preserve them from this generation forever.  
The wicked walk on every side when the most vile men are exalted.
