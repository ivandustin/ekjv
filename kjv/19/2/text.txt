Why do the nations rage, and the people plot in vain?  
The rulers of the earth rise up, and the leaders conspire together against the LORD and against His anointed, saying,  
"Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles."  
He who sits in heaven laughs; the LORD scoffs at them.  
Then He will speak to them in His anger and terrify them in His wrath.  
Yet I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.  
I will proclaim the LORD's decree: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father.  
Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.  
You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery."  
Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.  
Serve the LORD with fear and celebrate His rule with trembling.  
Kiss the Son, or He will be angry and your way will lead to destruction, for His wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
