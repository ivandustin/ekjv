The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not lack.  
He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters.  
He restores my soul; he guides me along the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
