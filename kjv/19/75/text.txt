To You, O God, we offer our thanks; we give thanks to You, for Your name is near and Your wondrous works are declared.
When I gather the congregation, I will judge with righteousness.
The earth and all its inhabitants are in turmoil; I uphold its pillars. Selah.
I said to the foolish, "Do not act foolishly," and to the wicked, "Do not lift up your horn."
Do not raise your horn on high; do not speak with a proud neck.
For promotion does not come from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
But God is the judge; He brings one down and lifts up another.
For in the hand of the LORD is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and He pours from it; but the dregs, all the wicked of the earth, will drain and drink.
But I will proclaim forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted high.
