To You, O LORD my rock, I cry; do not be silent to me: for if You remain silent, I will become like those who descend into the pit.
Hear the voice of my pleas as I cry out to You, lifting my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.
Do not drag me away with the wicked and the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while harboring malice in their hearts.
Repay them according to their deeds and the wickedness of their actions; give them the fruit of their hands; render to them what they deserve.
Since they do not consider the works of the LORD or the deeds of His hands, He will destroy them and not build them up.
Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard the voice of my pleas.
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; therefore, my heart rejoices greatly, and I will praise Him with my song.
The LORD is their strength, and He is the saving strength of His anointed.
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
