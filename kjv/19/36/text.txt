The transgressions of the wicked speak within my heart, declaring that there is no fear of God before his eyes.  
For he flatters himself in his own sight, until his iniquity is revealed as detestable.  
The words of his mouth are filled with iniquity and deceit; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.  
He plots mischief upon his bed; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he does not abhor evil.  
Your mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.  
Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a vast deep: O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.  
How excellent is your lovingkindness, O God! Therefore, the children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.  
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the richness of your house; and you shall make them drink from the river of your delights.  
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light, we shall see light.  
O continue your lovingkindness to those who know you; and your righteousness to the upright in heart.  
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.  
There the workers of iniquity have fallen; they are cast down and shall not be able to rise.
