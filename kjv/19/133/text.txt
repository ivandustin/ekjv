Behold, how wonderful and delightful it is for brothers to live together in harmony!  
It is like the precious oil poured on the head, flowing down onto the beard, even Aaron's beard; it trickles down to the edges of his garments.  
Like the dew of Hermon, and the dew that falls on the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD has commanded the blessing, even eternal life.
