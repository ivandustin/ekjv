O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before You.
Let my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry.
For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to the grave.
I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like a man who has no strength.
I am free among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more; they are cut off from Your hand.
You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the depths.
Your wrath lies heavily upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.
You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an abomination to them. I am shut in and cannot come forth.
My eye mourns because of my affliction; Lord, I have called upon You daily, I have stretched out my hands to You.
Will You show wonders to the dead? Will the dead arise and praise You? Selah.
Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in destruction?
Will Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But to You, O Lord, I have cried; and in the morning, my prayer will come before You.
Lord, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me?
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth; while I suffer Your terrors, I am distracted.
Your fierce wrath goes over me; Your terrors have cut me off.
They surround me daily like water; they encompass me together.
You have put lover and friend far from me, and my acquaintances into darkness.
