Be merciful to me, O God; be merciful to me, for my soul trusts in You. In the shadow of Your wings, I will find refuge until these calamities have passed.
I will cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me.
He will send from heaven and save me from the reproach of those who seek to swallow me up. Selah. God will send forth His mercy and His truth.
My soul is surrounded by lions; I lie among those who are set ablaze, among the sons of men whose teeth are like spears and arrows, and whose tongues are sharp swords.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me, into which they themselves have fallen. Selah.
My heart is steadfast, O God; my heart is steadfast. I will sing and give praise.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp. I will awaken early.
I will praise You, O Lord, among the people; I will sing to You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth to the clouds.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be above all the earth.
