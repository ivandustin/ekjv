Truly, my soul waits patiently for God; from Him comes my salvation.  
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be shaken.  
How long will you plot against a man? You shall all be slain; you will be like a bowing wall and a tottering fence.  
They only conspire to bring him down from his high position; they delight in falsehood; they bless with their mouths, but they curse inwardly. Selah.  
My soul, wait only upon God; for my hope is in Him.  
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be shaken.  
In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God.  
Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.  
Surely, men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; when weighed in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.  
Do not trust in oppression, and do not become vain in robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.  
God has spoken once; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God.  
Also, to You, O Lord, belongs mercy; for You render to every man according to his deeds.
