Hear my prayer, O LORD; listen to my supplications. In Your faithfulness, answer me, and in Your righteousness.  
Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no living person can be justified in Your sight.  
The enemy has persecuted my soul; he has brought my life down to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness, like those who have long been dead.  
Therefore, my spirit is overwhelmed within me; my heart is desolate.  
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I reflect on the work of Your hands.  
I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for You, like a parched land. Selah.  
Hear me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who go down to the pit.  
Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, for I trust in You. Show me the way I should walk, for I lift up my soul to You.  
Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I seek refuge in You.  
Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. Your Spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.  
Revive me, O LORD, for Your name's sake; for Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.  
In Your mercy, cut off my enemies and destroy all who afflict my soul, for I am Your servant.
