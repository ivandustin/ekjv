When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people speaking a foreign tongue;  
Judah became His sanctuary, and Israel His kingdom.  
The sea beheld it and fled; the Jordan turned back.  
The mountains leaped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.  
What troubled you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, why were you driven back?  
You mountains, why did you leap like rams? And you little hills, like lambs?  
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;  
Who transformed the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
