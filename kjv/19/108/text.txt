O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.  
Awake, psaltery and harp: I will rise early to sing.  
I will praise You, O LORD, among the people; I will sing praises to You among the nations.  
For Your mercy is great above the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the clouds.  
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Your glory be above all the earth.  
That Your beloved may be delivered; save with Your right hand and answer me.  
God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.  
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver.  
Moab is my washbasin; over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistia I will triumph.  
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me into Edom?  
Will You not, O God, who has rejected us? Will You not, O God, go out with our armies?  
Give us help in trouble, for the help of man is worthless.  
Through God, we shall do valiantly, for it is He who will trample down our enemies.
