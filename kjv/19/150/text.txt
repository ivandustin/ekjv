Praise the LORD! Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the expanse of His power.
Praise Him for His mighty deeds; praise Him for His excellent greatness.
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the lute and harp.
Praise Him with the tambourine and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes.
Praise Him with loud cymbals; praise Him with clashing cymbals.
Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Praise the LORD!
