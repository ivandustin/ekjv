I will praise you, O LORD; for you have lifted me up and have not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me.  
O LORD my God, I cried out to you, and you have healed me.  
O LORD, you have brought my soul up from the grave; you have kept me alive so that I do not descend into the pit.  
Sing to the LORD, O you saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.  
For His anger lasts only a moment; in His favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.  
And in my prosperity, I said, I shall never be shaken.  
LORD, by your favor, you have made my mountain stand strong; when you hid your face, I was troubled.  
I cried out to you, O LORD; and to the LORD, I made my supplication.  
What gain is there in my blood when I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it declare your truth?  
Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy on me: LORD, be my helper.  
You have turned my mourning into dancing; you have removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,  
So that my glory may sing praise to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.
