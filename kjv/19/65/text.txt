Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion; and to you, the vow shall be fulfilled.  
O you who hear prayer, to you all flesh shall come.  
Iniquities prevail against me; as for our transgressions, you shall cleanse them away.  
Blessed is the man whom you choose and bring near to you, that he may dwell in your courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, even of your holy temple.  
By awe-inspiring deeds in righteousness, you will answer us, O God of our salvation; you are the hope of all the ends of the earth and of those far off at sea.  
You, by your strength, establish the mountains, being girded with power.  
You calm the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.  
Those who dwell in the farthest parts are in awe of your signs; you make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.  
You visit the earth and water it; you greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water; you prepare grain for them when you have so provided for it.  
You water its ridges abundantly; you settle its furrows; you make it soft with showers; you bless its growth.  
You crown the year with your goodness, and your paths drip with abundance.  
They drip upon the pastures of the wilderness, and the little hills rejoice on every side.  
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys are also covered with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
