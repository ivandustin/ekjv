Give the king your judgments, O God, and your righteousness to the king's son.
He will judge your people with righteousness and your poor with fair judgment.
The mountains will bring peace to the people, and the little hills will do so through righteousness.
He will defend the poor among the people, save the children of the needy, and shatter the oppressor.
They will revere you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
He will descend like rain on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.
In his days, the righteous will flourish, and there will be an abundance of peace as long as the moon lasts.
He will have dominion from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth.
Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before him, and his enemies will lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and the isles will bring gifts; the kings of Sheba and Seba will offer presents.
Indeed, all kings will bow down before him; all nations will serve him.
For he will deliver the needy when they cry out; he will also save the poor and those who have no helper.
He will spare the poor and needy and will save the souls of the afflicted.
He will redeem their souls from deceit and violence, and their blood will be precious in his sight.
And he will live, and to him will be given the gold of Sheba; prayer will also be made for him continually, and he will be praised daily.
There will be a handful of corn on the earth atop the mountains; its fruit will shake like Lebanon, and those in the city will flourish like the grass of the earth.
His name will endure forever; his name will continue as long as the sun shines, and people will be blessed in him; all nations will call him blessed.
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
And blessed be his glorious name forever; let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are concluded.
