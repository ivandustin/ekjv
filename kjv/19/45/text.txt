My heart is expressing a noble thought: I speak of the things I have created concerning the king; my tongue is like the pen of a skilled writer.  
You are more beautiful than the children of men; grace flows from your lips; therefore, God has blessed you forever.  
Buckle your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty one, with your glory and majesty.  
And in your majesty ride triumphantly because of truth, humility, and righteousness; your right hand will teach you awe-inspiring things.  
Your arrows are sharp in the hearts of the king's enemies; as a result, the people fall before you.  
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of your kingdom is a righteous scepter.  
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your companions.  
All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, from the ivory palaces that have made you glad.  
Kings' daughters are among your noble women; at your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.  
Listen, O daughter, and pay attention; forget your own people and your father's house;  
So shall the king greatly desire your beauty, for he is your Lord; and you shall worship him.  
The daughter of Tyre will be there with a gift; even the wealthy among the people will seek your favor.  
The king's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is made of fine gold.  
She will be brought to the king in embroidered garments; her virgin companions who follow her will be brought to you.  
With joy and gladness, they will be brought; they will enter the king's palace.  
Instead of your fathers, your children will be; you may make them princes throughout the earth.  
I will make your name remembered in all generations; therefore, the people will praise you forever and ever.
