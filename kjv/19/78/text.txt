Listen, O my people, to my teachings: lend your ears to the words I speak.  
I will speak in a parable: I will share profound truths from the past.  
These are things we have heard and known, passed down to us by our ancestors.  
We will not conceal them from our children, but will proclaim to the next generation the praises of the LORD, his might, and the marvelous deeds he has done.  
For he established a testimony in Jacob and set a law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to make known to their children.  
So that the next generation may know them, even the children yet to be born; they will arise and declare them to their children.  
That they may place their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.  
And may not be like their forefathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation whose hearts were not right, and whose spirits were not steadfast with God.  
The children of Ephraim, armed and carrying bows, turned back on the day of battle.  
They did not keep the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;  
And forgot his works and the wonders he had shown them.  
He performed marvelous deeds in the sight of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  
He divided the sea and led them through; he made the waters stand like a wall.  
By day he led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.  
He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink from the great depths.  
He brought streams out of the rock and caused waters to flow like rivers.  
Yet they continued to sin against him, provoking the Most High in the wilderness.  
They tested God in their hearts by demanding food for their cravings.  
Yes, they spoke against God; they said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?"  
Look, he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he also give bread? Can he provide meat for his people?  
Therefore the LORD heard this and was angry; a fire was kindled against Jacob, and his anger rose against Israel.  
Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.  
Though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven,  
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and given them the grain of heaven.  
Man ate the food of angels; he sent them food in abundance.  
He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; by his power he brought in the south wind.  
He rained flesh upon them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.  
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.  
So they ate and were well filled; for he gave them what they desired.  
They were not estranged from their cravings. But while their food was still in their mouths,  
The anger of God rose against them and killed the strongest of them, and struck down the chosen men of Israel.  
Despite all this, they continued to sin and did not believe in his wondrous works.  
So he consumed their days in futility and their years in trouble.  
When he killed them, they sought him; they returned and earnestly sought God.  
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High their redeemer.  
Yet they flattered him with their mouths, and lied to him with their tongues.  
For their hearts were not right with him, nor were they steadfast in his covenant.  
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them; many times he turned his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath.  
For he remembered that they were but flesh, a passing wind that does not return.  
How often they provoked him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!  
Yes, they turned back and tested God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.  
They did not remember his power, nor the day when he redeemed them from the enemy.  
How he performed his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.  
He turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink from their streams.  
He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  
He gave their crops to the locust and their labor to the grasshopper.  
He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost.  
He gave up their cattle to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  
He unleashed his fierce anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.  
He made a path for his anger; he did not spare their souls from death, but gave their lives over to the plague;  
And struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.  
But he led his own people out like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  
He led them safely, so that they were not afraid; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to the mountain which his right hand had purchased.  
He drove out the nations before them and allotted them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.  
Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, and did not keep his testimonies.  
But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their ancestors; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.  
For they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their carved images.  
When God heard this, he was angry and greatly abhorred Israel.  
So he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had placed among men;  
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.  
He gave his people over to the sword and was angry with his inheritance.  
The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given in marriage.  
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows did not mourn.  
Then the LORD awoke as from sleep, like a mighty man shouting because of wine.  
And he struck his enemies in the back; he put them to a perpetual shame.  
Moreover, he rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;  
But chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved.  
And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.  
He chose David also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;  
From following the ewes that had young, he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.  
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
