O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor discipline me in your fierce wrath.  
Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.  
My soul is greatly troubled; but you, O LORD, how long will this last?  
Return, O LORD, and rescue my soul; save me for the sake of your mercy.  
For in death, there is no remembrance of you; in the grave, who can give you thanks?  
I am weary from my groaning; all night I make my bed swim, and I soak my couch with tears.  
My eyes are consumed with grief; they grow old because of all my foes.  
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.  
The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD will accept my prayer.  
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; let them return and be suddenly ashamed.
