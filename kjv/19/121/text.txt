I will lift my eyes to the hills, from where my help comes.  
My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth.  
He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber.  
Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.  
The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade at your right hand.  
The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.  
The LORD will protect you from all evil; He will guard your soul.  
The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
