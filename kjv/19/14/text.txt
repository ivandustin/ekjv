The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt; they have committed abominable acts; there is none who does good.
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any who understood and sought God.
They have all turned aside; they have all become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
Do all the workers of iniquity lack knowledge? They devour my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD.
There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.
You have shamed the counsel of the poor, for the LORD is his refuge.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice, and Israel will be glad.
