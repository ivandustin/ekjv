Hear me, O LORD; listen to my cry and give ear to my prayer, which comes from sincere lips.  
Let my case be presented before you; may your eyes see what is just.  
You have examined my heart; you have visited me at night; you have tested me and found no wrongdoing; I am determined that my mouth will not sin.  
Regarding the actions of men, by the words of your lips, I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.  
Guide my steps in your ways, so that my feet do not slip.  
I have called upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me and listen to my words.  
Show your marvelous lovingkindness, O you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from those who rise against them.  
Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings,  
from the wicked who oppress me, from my deadly enemies who surround me.  
They are enclosed in their own pride; with their mouths, they speak arrogantly.  
They have now surrounded us in our steps; they have set their eyes down to the ground;  
like a lion eager for its prey, like a young lion lurking in secret places.  
Arise, O LORD; disappoint him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword.  
From men who are your hand, O LORD, from men of the world who have their share in this life, and whose bellies you fill with your hidden treasures; they are full of children and leave the rest of their wealth to their offspring.  
As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied when I awake in your likeness.
