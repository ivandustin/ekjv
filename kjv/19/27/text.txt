The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  
When the wicked, even my enemies and foes, came upon me to devour my flesh, they stumbled and fell.  
Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I will be confident.  
One thing I have desired of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in His temple.  
For in the time of trouble, He shall hide me in His pavilion; in the secret of His tabernacle, He shall hide me; He shall set me upon a rock.  
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies round about me; therefore, I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises unto the LORD.  
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice; have mercy also upon me and answer me.  
When You said, "Seek My face," my heart said unto You, "Your face, LORD, will I seek."  
Hide not Your face far from me; do not put Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.  
When my father and mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.  
Teach me Your way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies.  
Do not deliver me over to the will of my enemies; for false witnesses have risen up against me, and those who breathe out cruelty.  
I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.  
Wait on the LORD; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the LORD.
