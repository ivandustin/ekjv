I will praise you, O LORD, with my entire heart; I will proclaim all your marvelous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.
When my enemies turn back, they will fall and perish in your presence.
For you have upheld my right and my cause; you sit on the throne judging righteously.
You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked, you have erased their name forever.
O enemy, destruction has come to a perpetual end; you have destroyed cities, their memory has perished with them.
But the LORD will endure forever; he has prepared his throne for judgment.
And he will judge the world in righteousness; he will administer justice to the people with integrity.
The LORD will also be a refuge for the oppressed, a safe haven in times of trouble.
And those who know your name will put their trust in you; for you, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; declare among the people his deeds.
When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them; he does not forget the cry of the humble.
Have mercy on me, O LORD; consider my trouble from those who hate me; you who lift me up from the gates of death.
That I may proclaim all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; I will rejoice in your salvation.
The nations have sunk down in the pit they made; in the net they hid, their own foot is caught.
The LORD is known by the judgment he executes; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
The wicked shall be turned to hell, and all the nations that forget God.
For the needy will not always be forgotten; the hope of the poor will not perish forever.
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in your sight.
Put them in fear, O LORD, that the nations may know they are but men. Selah.
