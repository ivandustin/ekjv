May God be merciful to us and bless us; may His face shine upon us; Selah.  
That Your way may be known throughout the earth, Your saving health among all nations.  
Let the people praise You, O God; let all the people praise You.  
O let the nations rejoice and sing for joy, for You shall judge the people righteously and govern the nations on earth. Selah.  
Let the people praise You, O God; let all the people praise You.  
Then the earth will yield its increase, and God, our own God, will bless us.  
God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will revere Him.
