The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and have committed abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any who understood, who sought God.
Everyone has turned away; they have all become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
Do the workers of iniquity have no knowledge? They devour my people as they eat bread; they do not call upon God.
There they were in great fear, where no fear existed; for God has scattered the bones of those who encamp against you; you have put them to shame because God has rejected them.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice, and Israel will be glad.
