Sing joyfully to God, our strength; make a cheerful noise to the God of Jacob.  
Take a psalm and bring the timbrel, the lovely harp, and the psaltery.  
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the appointed time, on our solemn feast day.  
For this is a statute for Israel, a law from the God of Jacob.  
He established this in Joseph as a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt, where I heard a language I did not understand.  
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the pots.  
You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.  
Listen, O my people, and I will testify to you: O Israel, if you will listen to me;  
There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not worship any foreign god.  
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.  
But my people would not listen to my voice; and Israel did not want me.  
So I gave them up to their own hearts' desires; they followed their own counsels.  
Oh, that my people had listened to me, and Israel had walked in my ways!  
I would soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries.  
The haters of the LORD would have submitted to him, but their time would have lasted forever.  
He would have fed them with the finest wheat, and with honey from the rock, I would have satisfied you.
