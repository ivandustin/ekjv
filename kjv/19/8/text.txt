O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is Your name throughout the earth! You have placed Your glory above the heavens.  
From the mouths of infants and nursing babies, You have established strength to silence Your foes and the avenger.  
When I reflect on the heavens, the work of Your hands, the moon and the stars that You have set in place;  
What is mankind that You are mindful of him? And the son of man that You care for him?  
For You have made him a little lower than the angels and have crowned him with glory and honor.  
You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet:  
All sheep and oxen, yes, and the creatures of the field;  
The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, and everything that swims the paths of the seas.  
O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is Your name throughout the earth!
