I will praise the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.  
My soul will boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and rejoice.  
Come, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.  
I sought the LORD, and he answered me, delivering me from all my fears.  
They looked to him and were radiant; their faces were never ashamed.  
This poor man cried out, and the LORD heard him, saving him from all his troubles.  
The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him and delivers them.  
O taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the one who trusts in him.  
O fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.  
Young lions may go hungry and suffer want, but those who seek the LORD will lack no good thing.  
Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.  
Who among you desires life and loves many days to see good?  
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.  
Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.  
The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry.  
The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to erase their memory from the earth.  
The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them, delivering them from all their troubles.  
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.  
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers them from them all.  
He protects all his bones; not one of them will be broken.  
Evil will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.  
The LORD redeems the souls of his servants, and none who trust in him will be condemned.
