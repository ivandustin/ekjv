How long, O LORD, will You forget me? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?  
How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy triumph over me?  
Look on me and answer, O LORD my God; give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death.  
My enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall.  
But I have trusted in Your unfailing love; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.  
I will sing to the LORD, for He has been good to me.
