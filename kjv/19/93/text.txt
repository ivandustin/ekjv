The LORD reigns; He is clothed in majesty. The LORD is adorned with strength, which He has wrapped around Himself. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.  
Your throne has been established from ancient times; You are from everlasting.  
The floods have risen, O LORD; the floods have raised their voices; the floods crash with their waves.  
The LORD on high is mightier than the tumult of many waters, yes, even stronger than the mighty waves of the sea.  
Your testimonies are exceedingly reliable; holiness is fitting for Your house, O LORD, forever.
