Do not remain silent, O God; do not hold your peace, and do not be still, O God.
For behold, your enemies are in an uproar, and those who hate you have raised their heads.
They have taken crafty counsel against your people and conspired against your hidden ones.
They have said, "Come, let us cut them off from being a nation, so that the name of Israel will be no more remembered."
For they have conspired together with one mind; they are united against you.
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarenes;
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines along with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria has also joined them; they have aided the children of Lot. Selah.
Deal with them as you did with the Midianites, as with Sisera and Jabin at the brook of Kishon;
Who perished at Endor; they became like dung on the ground.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Who said, "Let us take possession of the houses of God."
O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind.
As fire consumes the forest and flames set the mountains ablaze;
So pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.
Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O LORD.
Let them be confounded and troubled forever; let them be put to shame and perish,
That people may know that you, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the Most High over all the earth.
