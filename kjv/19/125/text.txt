Those who trust in the LORD will be like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.  
Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people now and forever.  
The scepter of the wicked will not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous do not turn to iniquity.  
Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in heart.  
But as for those who turn to their crooked ways, the LORD will lead them away with the workers of iniquity; peace will be upon Israel.
