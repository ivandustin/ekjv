To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.  
O my God, I place my trust in you: do not let me be put to shame, and do not let my enemies triumph over me.  
Indeed, let none who wait for you be put to shame; let those be ashamed who act treacherously without cause.  
Show me your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths.  
Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; I wait for you all day long.  
Remember, O LORD, your tender mercies and your lovingkindnesses; they have been from of old.  
Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your mercy, remember me for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.  
Good and upright is the LORD; therefore, he instructs sinners in the way.  
He guides the humble in justice and teaches the humble his way.  
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.  
For the sake of your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great.  
Who is the man that fears the LORD? Him will he teach the way he should choose.  
His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his offspring will inherit the earth.  
The secret of the LORD is with those who fear him, and he will show them his covenant.  
My eyes are always on the LORD, for he will free my feet from the snare.  
Turn to me and have mercy on me, for I am lonely and afflicted.  
The troubles of my heart have increased; bring me out of my distresses.  
Look upon my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.  
Consider my enemies, for they are numerous, and they hate me with violent hatred.  
O guard my soul and deliver me; do not let me be put to shame, for I put my trust in you.  
May integrity and uprightness protect me, for I wait for you.  
Redeem Israel, O God, from all his troubles.
