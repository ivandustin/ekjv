Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise against me.  
Rescue me from the evildoers, and save me from violent men.  
For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty gather against me, not for my transgressions or my sins, O LORD.  
They prepare themselves without cause; awaken to help me and see.  
Therefore, O LORD God of hosts, God of Israel, awaken to confront all the nations; do not show mercy to any wicked transgressors. Selah.  
They return at evening; they make noise like dogs and roam around the city.  
Behold, they spew out threats with their mouths; swords are on their lips, for they say, "Who hears?"  
But you, O LORD, will laugh at them; you will hold all the nations in derision.  
Because of his strength, I will wait for you; for God is my defense.  
The God of my mercy will go before me; God will let me see my desire upon my enemies.  
Do not slay them, lest my people forget; scatter them by your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.  
For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride; for the cursing and lying they speak.  
Consume them in wrath, consume them so they may be no more; let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.  
And at evening, let them return; let them make noise like dogs and roam around the city.  
Let them wander up and down for food and grumble if they are not satisfied.  
But I will sing of your power; yes, I will sing aloud of your mercy in the morning, for you have been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble.  
To you, O my strength, I will sing; for God is my defense and the God of my mercy.
