The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: He sits enthroned between the cherubim; let the earth shake.  
The LORD is great in Zion; He is exalted above all the nations.  
Let them praise Your great and awesome name; for it is holy.  
The king's strength loves justice; You establish fairness, You execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.  
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; for He is holy.  
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called upon His name; they called upon the LORD, and He answered them.  
He spoke to them from the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the statutes He gave them.  
You answered them, O LORD our God; You were a God who forgave them, yet You took vengeance on their deeds.  
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy.
