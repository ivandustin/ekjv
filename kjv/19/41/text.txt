Blessed is the one who considers the poor; the LORD will rescue him in times of trouble.  
The LORD will protect him and keep him alive; he will be blessed on the earth, and you will not hand him over to the desires of his enemies.  
The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed; you will restore him to health during his illness.  
I said, LORD, be merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.  
My enemies speak ill of me, asking, "When will he die, and when will his name be forgotten?"  
And if he comes to visit me, he speaks deceitfully; his heart gathers iniquity to itself, and when he goes out, he tells it.  
All who hate me whisper together against me; they plot my harm.  
They say, "An evil disease clings to him; now that he lies down, he will not rise again."  
Even my close friend, whom I trusted, who shared my bread, has turned against me.  
But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up, so that I may repay them.  
By this, I know that you favor me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.  
And as for me, you uphold me in my integrity and place me in your presence forever.  
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
