The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."  
The LORD will send the rod of your strength from Zion: rule in the midst of your enemies.  
Your people will be willing on the day of your power, in the beauty of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.  
The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."  
The Lord at your right hand will strike through kings on the day of His wrath.  
He will judge among the nations; He will fill the places with dead bodies; He will wound the heads over many countries.  
He will drink from the brook along the way; therefore, He will lift up His head.
