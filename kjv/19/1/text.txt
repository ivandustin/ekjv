Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of mockers.
But their delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law, they meditate day and night.
They shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season; its leaves do not wither, and whatever they do shall prosper.
The wicked are not so; they are like chaff that the wind blows away.
Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
