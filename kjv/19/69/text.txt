Save me, O God; for the waters have risen up to my soul.  
I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have entered deep waters, where the floods overwhelm me.  
I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched; my eyes fail as I wait for my God.  
Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs on my head; those who seek to destroy me, my wrongful enemies, are powerful; yet I restored what I did not take.  
O God, you are aware of my foolishness; my sins are not hidden from you.  
Do not let those who wait for you, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because of me; do not let those who seek you be confounded because of me, O God of Israel.  
For your sake, I have endured reproach; shame has covered my face.  
I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's children.  
For the zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen upon me.  
When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it was to my disgrace.  
I made sackcloth my garment, and I became a proverb to them.  
Those who sit at the gate speak against me, and I am the song of the drunkards.  
But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of your mercy, hear me, in the truth of your salvation.  
Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink; rescue me from those who hate me and from the deep waters.  
Do not let the floodwaters overwhelm me, nor let the deep swallow me up; do not let the pit close its mouth over me.  
Hear me, O LORD, for your lovingkindness is good; turn to me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.  
And do not hide your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; answer me quickly.  
Draw near to my soul and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies.  
You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; my adversaries are all before you.  
Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness; I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.  
They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.  
Let their table become a snare before them; and what should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.  
Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see; and make their loins tremble continually.  
Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your fierce anger seize them.  
Let their dwelling place be desolate; and let no one live in their tents.  
For they persecute him whom you have struck down; and they speak of the grief of those whom you have wounded.  
Add guilt to their guilt; and let them not come into your righteousness.  
Let them be erased from the book of the living, and not be listed among the righteous.  
But I am poor and sorrowful; let your salvation, O God, lift me up.  
I will praise the name of God with a song, and I will magnify him with thanksgiving.  
This will please the LORD more than an ox or bull with horns and hooves.  
The humble will see this and be glad; and your hearts shall live, you who seek God.  
For the LORD hears the poor and does not despise his prisoners.  
Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves in them.  
For God will save Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah; that they may dwell there and possess it.  
The offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell there.
