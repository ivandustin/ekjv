The earth belongs to the LORD, along with everything in it; the world and all its inhabitants.  
For He has established it upon the seas and set it upon the waters.  
Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who can stand in His holy place?  
Those with clean hands and a pure heart; who have not lifted their souls to vanity or sworn deceitfully.  
They will receive blessings from the LORD and righteousness from the God of their salvation.  
This is the generation that seeks Him, that seeks Your face, O Jacob. Selah.  
Lift up your heads, O gates; be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory will enter.  
Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty; the LORD, mighty in battle.  
Lift up your heads, O gates; lift them up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory will enter.  
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts; He is the King of glory. Selah.
