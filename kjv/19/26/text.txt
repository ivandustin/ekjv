Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity; I have also trusted in the LORD, and therefore I shall not be shaken.  
Examine me, O LORD, and test me; try my heart and my mind.  
For your lovingkindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.  
I have not sat with deceitful people, nor will I associate with hypocrites.  
I have hated the assembly of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked.  
I will wash my hands in innocence; so I will go around your altar, O LORD,  
That I may proclaim with a voice of thanksgiving and tell of all your marvelous deeds.  
LORD, I have loved the dwelling place of your house and the place where your glory resides.  
Do not gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with violent men,  
In whose hands are wicked schemes, and whose right hand is full of bribes.  
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.  
My foot stands on level ground; in the congregations, I will bless the LORD.
