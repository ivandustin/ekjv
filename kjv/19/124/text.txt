If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, let Israel now proclaim;  
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side when adversaries rose against us;  
Then they would have swiftly swallowed us alive when their anger was ignited against us;  
Then the waters would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over our very being;  
Then the proud waves would have surged over our soul.  
Blessed be the LORD, who has not allowed us to become prey to their teeth.  
Our soul has escaped like a bird from the trap of the fowlers; the trap is broken, and we have been freed.  
Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth.
