In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he had troubling dreams that disturbed his spirit and interrupted his sleep.  
The king then ordered the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to be summoned to interpret his dreams. They came and stood before him.  
The king said to them, "I have had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to understand it."  
The Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will provide the interpretation."  
The king replied to the Chaldeans, "The matter has escaped me: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut into pieces, and your houses shall be made a refuse heap."  
"But if you reveal the dream and its interpretation, you will receive gifts, rewards, and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its interpretation."  
They answered again, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it."  
The king responded, "I know for certain that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the matter has escaped me."  
"If you do not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me until the situation changes. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it."  
The Chaldeans answered the king, "There is no man on earth who can reveal the king's matter; therefore, no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean."  
"It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no one who can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."  
For this reason, the king was angry and very furious, commanding that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.  
The decree was issued that the wise men should be killed, and they sought Daniel and his companions to execute them.  
Then Daniel spoke with wisdom and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.  
He asked Arioch, "Why is the decree from the king so urgent?" Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel.  
Daniel went in and requested the king to give him time so that he could interpret the dream for him.  
Then Daniel returned to his house and informed Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,  
that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  
Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  
Daniel said, "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.  
He changes times and seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.  
He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with Him.  
I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers, for You have given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me what we asked of You, for You have made known to us the king's matter."  
Therefore, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show him the interpretation."  
Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel before the king and said, "I have found a man among the captives of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation."  
The king asked Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"  
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, "The secret which the king has demanded cannot be shown by the wise men, astrologers, magicians, or soothsayers.  
But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed are these:  
As for you, O king, your thoughts came to your mind while on your bed about what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen.  
But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living being, but for their sakes who will make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.  
You, O king, saw a great image. This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you, and its form was awesome.  
The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,  
its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.  
You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay and broke them in pieces.  
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace was found for them. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.  
This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation before the king.  
You, O king, are a king of kings; for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.  
And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, He has given into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.  
And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.  
And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and like iron that crushes all these, it shall break in pieces and crush.  
As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with clay.  
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.  
And as you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.  
And in the days of these kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.  
Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure."  
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet incense to him.  
The king spoke to Daniel and said, "Truly, your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret."  
Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.  
Daniel requested the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel remained at the king's court.
