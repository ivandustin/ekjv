In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar; the revelation was true, but the appointed time was long. He understood the matter and gained insight into the vision.
During those days, I, Daniel, mourned for three full weeks.
I ate no delicacies, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, and I did not anoint myself at all until the three weeks were completed.
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was beside the great river, which is the Tigris;
I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, with his waist girded with fine gold from Uphaz.
His body was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs resembled polished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the roar of a multitude.
I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
So I was left alone and saw this great vision; no strength remained in me, for my appearance turned to ruin, and I had no strength left.
Yet I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground.
And behold, a hand touched me, setting me on my knees and the palms of my hands.
He said to me, "O Daniel, greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you." And when he spoke this word to me, I stood trembling.
Then he said to me, "Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words.
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me for twenty-one days; but behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to many days ahead."
When he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless.
And behold, one resembling a man touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, "O my lord, because of the vision, my sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have no strength left."
For how can I, your servant, speak with you, my lord? For now, no strength remains in me, nor is there breath left in me.
Then again, one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me.
He said, "O man greatly beloved, do not fear; peace be to you; be strong, yes, be strong." And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed, the prince of Greece will come.
But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth; no one upholds me against these except Michael, your prince."
