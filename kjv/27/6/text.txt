It pleased Darius to appoint one hundred and twenty princes to oversee the entire kingdom;  
And over these, he appointed three presidents, with Daniel as the chief, so that the princes would report to them, ensuring the king suffered no loss.  
Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was within him; the king considered placing him over the entire realm.  
The presidents and princes sought to find grounds for accusing Daniel regarding the kingdom, but they could find no reason or fault, as he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.  
Then these men said, "We will not find any grounds for accusation against this Daniel unless it is in connection with the law of his God."  
So the presidents and princes gathered together to the king and said to him, "King Darius, live forever!"  
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, the princes, the counselors, and the captains have conspired to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that anyone who asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.  
Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the document so that it cannot be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.  
Therefore, King Darius signed the document and the decree.  
When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went to his house; and with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, just as he had done previously.  
Then these men gathered and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.  
They approached the king and spoke concerning the king's decree: "Have you not signed a decree that anyone who asks a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions?" The king answered, "The decree is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed."  
They replied to the king, "That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."  
When the king heard these words, he was greatly distressed and set his mind on Daniel to rescue him; he struggled until sunset to save him.  
Then these men came to the king and said, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed."  
The king commanded, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, "Your God, whom you serve continually, will deliver you."  
A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that nothing could be changed regarding Daniel.  
Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no musicians were brought before him, and his sleep fled from him.  
At dawn, the king arose and hurried to the den of lions.  
When he came near the den, he cried out in a lamenting voice to Daniel; the king spoke and said to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?"  
Daniel replied to the king, "O king, live forever!  
My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths, so they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong."  
The king was overjoyed and commanded that Daniel be lifted out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury was found on him because he had trusted in his God.  
The king commanded that those men who had accused Daniel be brought and cast into the den of lions, along with their children and their wives; and the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces before they reached the bottom of the den.  
Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: "Peace be multiplied to you."  
I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom, people must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, enduring forever; His kingdom shall not be destroyed, and His dominion shall be to the end.  
He delivers and rescues; He performs signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, for He has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.  
So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
