Nebuchadnezzar, the king, constructed a golden image, standing sixty cubits tall and six cubits wide, and erected it in the plain of Dura, within the province of Babylon.  
Subsequently, King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the provincial rulers to attend the dedication of the image he had set up.  
The princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the provincial rulers gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had established, standing before it.  
Then a herald proclaimed loudly, "To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,  
That when you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.  
And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace at that very hour."  
Therefore, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, they fell down and worshipped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.  
At that time, certain Chaldeans approached and accused the Jews.  
They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!  
You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, must fall down and worship the golden image.  
And whoever does not fall down and worship must be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  
There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylonâ€”Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up."  
In his rage and fury, Nebuchadnezzar commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him. They were then presented to the king.  
Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image I have set up?  
Now, if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image I have made, good; but if you do not worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the God that will deliver you from my hands?"  
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves in this matter.  
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king.  
But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up."  
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual.  
He ordered the strongest men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the burning fiery furnace.  
So these men were bound in their coats, trousers, turbans, and other garments, and cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  
Because the king's command was urgent and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flames killed the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; he rose in haste and spoke to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?" They answered and said to the king, "True, O king."  
He replied, "Look! I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."  
Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and called out, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.  
The princes, governors, captains, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw these men, on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their heads was not singed, their coats were not changed, and the smell of fire was not on them.  
Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve or worship any god except their own God.  
Therefore, I make a decree that every people, nation, and language that speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, for there is no other God who can deliver in this way."  
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
