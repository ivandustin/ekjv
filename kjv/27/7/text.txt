In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions in his mind while on his bed. He then wrote down the dream and summarized the events.
Daniel spoke and said, "I saw in my night vision, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea."
And four great beasts emerged from the sea, each different from the others.
The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings. I watched until its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a human heart was given to it.
And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear, raised itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. They said to it, "Arise, devour much flesh."
After this, I looked, and there was another beast, like a leopard, which had four wings of a bird on its back; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
After this, I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong; it had great iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns.
I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. In this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
I watched until the thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was like a fiery flame, and its wheels were burning fire.
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. Thousands upon thousands ministered to Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.
I watched then because of the sound of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame.
As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven and approached the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.
And to Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and His kingdom is one that shall not be destroyed.
I, Daniel, was troubled in my spirit, and the visions in my mind disturbed me.
I approached one of those standing by and asked him the truth of all this. He told me and made known to me the interpretation of the matters.
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings that shall arise from the earth.
But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess it forever, even forever and ever.
Then I wanted to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with iron teeth and bronze claws; it devoured, crushed, and trampled the residue with its feet.
And about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up, before which three fell; that horn had eyes and a mouth that spoke very great things, and its appearance was greater than its companions.
I watched, and that same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them.
Until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.
Thus he said: "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all other kingdoms. It shall devour the whole earth, trample it down, and break it in pieces.
And the ten horns from this kingdom are ten kings who shall arise; and another shall rise after them. He shall be different from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws. They shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
But the court shall be seated, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and destroy it forever.
And the kingdom, dominion, and greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.
This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.
