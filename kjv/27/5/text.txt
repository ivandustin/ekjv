Belshazzar, the king, hosted a grand feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in their presence.  
While tasting the wine, Belshazzar commanded that the golden and silver vessels, which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, be brought forth so that he, his princes, wives, and concubines could drink from them.  
They brought the golden vessels taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king, his princes, wives, and concubines drank from them.  
They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone.  
At that moment, fingers of a man's hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall opposite the candlestick in the king's palace; the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.  
The king's expression changed, and his thoughts troubled him, causing his loins to weaken and his knees to knock together.  
The king called out to bring in the astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. He spoke to the wise men of Babylon, saying that whoever could read the writing and interpret it would be clothed in scarlet, wear a gold chain around his neck, and be the third ruler in the kingdom.  
All the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or explain its interpretation to the king.  
King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, his expression changed, and his lords were astonished.  
The queen, hearing the words of the king and his lords, entered the banquet hall and said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance change.  
There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods; in the days of your father, light, understanding, and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, made him master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers.  
An excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding, interpreting dreams, explaining riddles, and solving problems were found in Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be summoned, and he will give you the interpretation."  
Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked Daniel, "Are you that Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father brought from Jerusalem?"  
"I have heard of you," the king continued, "that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you."  
"Now the wise men and astrologers have been brought before me to read this writing and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not explain it.  
I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. If you can read the writing and tell me its interpretation, you will be clothed in scarlet, wear a gold chain around your neck, and be the third ruler in the kingdom."  
Daniel answered the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.  
O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, majesty, glory, and honor.  
Because of the majesty he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he wished, kept alive whom he wished, elevated whom he wished, and humbled whom he wished.  
But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken from him.  
He was driven away from mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast; his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like oxen, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of men and appoints over it whomever He wills.  
And you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this.  
Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you, your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, hear, or know; and the God who holds your breath in His hand and controls all your ways, you have not glorified.  
Therefore, the hand was sent from Him, and this writing was inscribed.  
This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.  
This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE: God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end.  
TEKEL: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.  
PERES: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."  
Then Belshazzar commanded that Daniel be clothed in scarlet, a gold chain be put around his neck, and a proclamation be made concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.  
That very night, Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, was slain.  
And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
