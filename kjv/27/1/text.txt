In the third year of Jehoiakim's reign as king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.  
The Lord delivered Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hands, along with some of the sacred vessels from the house of God, which he took to the land of Shinar and placed in the temple of his god; he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his deity.  
The king instructed Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs, to bring certain young men from the children of Israel, including those from the royal family and nobility;  
young men without physical defect, handsome, well-versed in all wisdom, knowledgeable, and capable of understanding complex matters, who had the potential to serve in the king's palace, and whom they could teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans.  
The king assigned them a daily portion of his royal food and the wine he drank, nourishing them for three years, so that at the end of that time they might serve before the king.  
Among these were four young men from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.  
The chief of the eunuchs gave them new names: Daniel was called Belteshazzar, Hananiah was called Shadrach, Mishael was called Meshach, and Azariah was called Abednego.  
However, Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food or the wine he drank; so he asked the chief of the eunuchs for permission not to defile himself.  
Now God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief of the eunuchs.  
But the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."  
Then Daniel spoke to Melzar, the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,  
"Please test your servants for ten days; give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.  
Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and deal with your servants according to what you see."  
So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.  
At the end of the ten days, they looked healthier and better nourished than all the young men who ate the royal food.  
So Melzar took away their royal food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables instead.  
As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom; and Daniel had insight into all visions and dreams.  
At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief of the eunuchs presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.  
The king talked with them, and among them all, none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore, they served before the king.  
In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.  
And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
