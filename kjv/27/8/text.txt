In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, following the one I had seen previously.  
I saw in a vision; and as I looked, I found myself in Shushan, the palace, in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, standing by the river Ulai.  
Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram with two horns: the horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.  
I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward; so that no beasts could stand before him, nor was there anyone who could deliver from his hand; he did as he pleased and became great.  
As I was contemplating this, behold, a goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground: the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.  
He approached the ram with two horns, which I had seen standing by the river, and ran at him in the fury of his power.  
I saw him come close to the ram, and he was filled with rage against him, struck the ram, and broke his two horns: the ram had no strength to stand before him, so he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him; there was no one who could rescue the ram from his hand.  
Therefore, the goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its place came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.  
Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, the east, and the pleasant land.  
It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and the stars to the ground, and trampled on them.  
Yes, it magnified itself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.  
A host was given to him against the daily sacrifice because of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; it practiced and prospered.  
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint who spoke, "How long will the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation last, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?"  
He said to me, "For two thousand and three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed."  
When I, Daniel, had seen the vision and sought for its meaning, behold, there stood before me one with the appearance of a man.  
I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, calling and saying, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."  
So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision."  
As he spoke with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground: but he touched me and set me upright.  
He said, "Behold, I will make you know what shall happen in the last end of the indignation: for at the appointed time, the end shall come."  
The ram that you saw with two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.  
The rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.  
Now that being broken, four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation, but not with his power.  
In the latter time of their kingdom, when transgressors have reached their fullness, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall arise.  
His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.  
Through his policy, he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand; he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without human intervention.  
The vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: therefore, seal up the vision; for it shall be for many days.  
I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for several days; afterward, I rose up and did the king's business; I was astonished at the vision, but no one understood it.
