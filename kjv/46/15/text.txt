Moreover, dear brethren, I declare to you the gospel that I preached to you, which you have also received, and in which you stand firm;  
By which you are saved, if you hold fast to the message I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.  
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;  
And that he was buried, and that he rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures;  
And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve;  
After that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.  
After that, he was seen by James; then by all the apostles.  
And last of all, he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.  
For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.  
But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; rather, I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.  
Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.  
Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?  
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen;  
And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain.  
Yes, and we are found to be false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise up if the dead do not rise.  
For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not raised;  
And if Christ is not raised, your faith is in vain; you are still in your sins.  
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.  
But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.  
For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.  
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  
But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward, those who are Christ's at his coming.  
Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.  
For he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet.  
The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.  
For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is evident that he is excepted, who put all things under him.  
And when all things are made subject to him, then the Son himself will also be subject to him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  
Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?  
And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?  
I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  
If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me if the dead do not rise? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.  
Do not be deceived: evil company corrupts good habits.  
Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.  
But someone will say, "How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?"  
Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.  
And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.  
But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to each seed its own body.  
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds.  
There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  
There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.  
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.  
It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  
And so it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.  
The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second man is the Lord from heaven.  
As was the earthy man, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are heavenly.  
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.  
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  
So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."  
O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?  
The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.  
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
