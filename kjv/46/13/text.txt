Though I may speak with the languages of humans and angels, if I lack love, I am merely a clanging gong or a resounding cymbal.  
And even if I possess the gift of prophecy, comprehend all mysteries, and have all knowledge; even if I have faith strong enough to move mountains, without love, I am nothing.  
And if I give away all my possessions to help the poor, and even sacrifice my body to be burned, without love, it benefits me nothing.  
Love is patient and kind; it does not envy; it does not boast; it is not proud.  
It does not act improperly, seeks not its own interests, is not easily angered, and keeps no record of wrongs.  
It does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth.  
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.  
Love never fails: but whether there are prophecies, they will cease; whether there are languages, they will come to an end; whether there is knowledge, it will pass away.  
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  
But when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with.  
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I understood like a child, I thought like a child: but when I became an adult, I put away childish things.  
For now we see through a glass, dimly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I will know fully, just as I am fully known.  
And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
