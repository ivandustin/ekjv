Regarding things offered to idols, we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge can lead to arrogance, but love builds up.  
If anyone thinks they know anything, they do not yet know as they ought to know.  
But if anyone loves God, they are known by Him.  
Concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and there is no other God but one.  
Though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (and there are many gods and many lords),  
to us, there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come, and we exist in Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things exist, and we live through Him.  
However, not everyone has this knowledge; some, with a conscience still sensitive to the idol, eat it as if it were a thing offered to an idol, and their weak conscience is defiled.  
But food does not bring us closer to God; we are no better if we eat, nor worse if we do not eat.  
Be careful, however, that this liberty of yours does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.  
For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, will not their weak conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?  
And through your knowledge, the weak brother may perish, for whom Christ died.  
When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.  
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will not eat meat as long as the world exists, so that I do not cause my brother to stumble.
