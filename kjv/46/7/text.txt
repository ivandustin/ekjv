Now regarding the matters you wrote to me about: it is good for a man not to engage with a woman.
However, to prevent fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
Let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and similarly, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
Do not deprive one another, except by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, so that Satan does not tempt you due to your lack of self-control.
But I say this with permission, not as a command.
For I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.
I therefore say to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them to remain as I am.
But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
And to the married, I command, yet not I, but the Lord: let not the wife separate from her husband.
But if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the husband put away his wife.
But to the rest, I speak, not the Lord: if any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not put her away.
And if a woman has a husband who does not believe, and if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through the husband; otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
But if the unbelieving departs, let him depart. A brother or sister is not bound in such cases: but God has called us to peace.
For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O man, whether you will save your wife?
But as God has assigned to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And I ordain this in all churches.
Is any man called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.
Let each man remain in the same condition in which he was called.
Were you called while a servant? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use it.
For he who is called in the Lord while a servant is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who is called while free is Christ's servant.
You were bought at a price; do not become the servants of men.
Brethren, let each one remain in the condition in which he was called, with God.
Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give my judgment as one who has received mercy from the Lord to be faithful.
I think, therefore, that this is good because of the present distress: that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless, such will have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.
But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remains that both those who have wives should be as though they had none;
And those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;
And those who use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world is passing away.
But I want you to be free from concern. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
But he who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
And this I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.
But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes; he does not sin: let them marry.
Nevertheless, he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.
So then, he who gives her in marriage does well; but he who does not give her in marriage does better.
A wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.
