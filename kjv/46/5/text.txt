It is commonly reported that there is immorality among you, and such immorality that is not even mentioned among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
And you are arrogant, and have not rather mourned, so that the one who has committed this act might be removed from among you.
For I truly, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as if I were present, concerning the one who has committed this act,
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit is with you, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
To deliver such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?
Therefore, cleanse out the old yeast, so that you may be a new batch, as you are unleavened. For even Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us:
Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with old yeast, nor with the yeast of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people:
Yet I did not mean the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters; for then you would need to go out of the world.
But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality, or greed, or is an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or a swindler; with such a person, do not even eat.
For what have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
But those outside, God will judge. Therefore, remove from among yourselves that wicked person.
