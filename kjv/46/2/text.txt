And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with eloquence of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
For I resolved to know nothing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And I was with you in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
And my message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
So that your faith would not rest in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
However, we do speak wisdom among those who are mature: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, which come to nothing:
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world for our glory:
Which none of the rulers of this world understood; for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love him.
But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Likewise, no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
These things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Holy Spirit; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
