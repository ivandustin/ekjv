In those days, Hezekiah was gravely ill. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, visited him and said, "Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live."

Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying, "I beseech you, O LORD, remember how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in your sight." Hezekiah wept bitterly.

Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "Return and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you shall go up to the house of the LORD.'"

"I will add fifteen years to your life; I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."

Isaiah instructed, "Take a lump of figs." They took the figs and applied them to the boil, and he recovered.

Hezekiah asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?"

Isaiah replied, "This will be the sign from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?"

Hezekiah answered, "It is easy for the shadow to go down ten degrees; rather, let the shadow return backward ten degrees."

Then Isaiah the prophet cried out to the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back ten degrees on the sundial of Ahaz.

At that time, Berodachbaladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah was ill.

Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them all the treasures of his house: the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment, and all his armory. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They have come from a distant country, from Babylon."

Isaiah asked, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."

Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD. Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have stored up to this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the LORD."

"And of your sons who will come from you, whom you will father, they shall take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."

Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." He added, "Is it not good if there is peace and truth in my days?"

The rest of the acts of Hezekiah, including all his might, how he made a pool and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and his son Manasseh reigned in his place.
