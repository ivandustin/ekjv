In his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim served him for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
And the LORD sent against him groups of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites, sending them against Judah to destroy it, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken through his prophets.
Surely, at the command of the LORD, this came upon Judah to remove them from his sight, due to the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done.
Additionally, for the innocent blood he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the LORD would not forgive.
Now, the remaining acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
So Jehoiakim rested with his ancestors, and his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.
And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his father.
At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
And Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, along with his mother, servants, princes, and officers; the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
He carried away all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house, and he cut in pieces all the gold vessels that Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded.
He carried away all of Jerusalem, including all the princes and the mighty men of valor, a total of ten thousand captives, along with all the craftsmen and smiths; none remained except for the poorest of the people of the land.
He took Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with the king's mother, wives, officers, and the mighty of the land, those he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
All the men of valor, seven thousand in total, along with a thousand craftsmen and smiths, all strong and fit for war, were taken captive to Babylon by the king.
The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father's brother, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following all that Jehoiakim had done.
For through the anger of the LORD, it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
