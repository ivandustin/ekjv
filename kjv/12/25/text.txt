And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came with all his army against Jerusalem and encamped around it; they built forts against it on every side.
And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
On the ninth day of the fourth month, famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
The city was breached, and all the men of war fled by night through the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were surrounding the city:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
The army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; all his army was scattered from him.
So they captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where judgment was pronounced upon him.
They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
He burned down the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great man's house was burned with fire.
All the army of the Chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.
Now the rest of the people who were left in the city, and the fugitives who had defected to the king of Babylon, along with the remnant of the multitude, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away.
But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, along with the bases and the bronze sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
They took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and all the vessels of bronze used in their service.
The firepans and bowls, along with items made of gold and silver, the captain of the guard took away.
The two pillars, one sea, and the bases that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the bronze of all these vessels was beyond measure.
The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter on it was of bronze; the height of the chapiter was three cubits, and the wreathen work and pomegranates on the chapiter all around were of bronze; the second pillar was similar, with wreathen work.
The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door.
He also took an officer who was in charge of the men of war, five men who were in the king's presence, the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
The king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus, Judah was carried away from their land.
As for the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler over them.
When all the captains of the armies and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, including Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, along with their men.
Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
But it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
It came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison.
He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
He changed his prison garments and ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
His allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.
