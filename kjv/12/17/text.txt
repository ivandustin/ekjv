In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, the son of Elah, began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years.
He committed acts that were evil in the sight of the LORD, but not to the same extent as the kings of Israel who preceded him.
Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came against him; thus, Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute.
The king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy involving Hoshea, as he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and did not bring gifts to the king of Assyria as he had done in previous years. Therefore, the king of Assyria imprisoned him.
Then the king of Assyria invaded the entire land, went up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, carried Israel away to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
This occurred because the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the authority of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and had worshipped other gods.
They followed the practices of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the children of Israel, as well as the customs established by the kings of Israel.
The children of Israel secretly committed acts that were not right in the sight of the LORD their God, building high places in all their cities, from the watchtower to the fortified city.
They set up images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.
There, they burned incense on all the high places, imitating the practices of the nations whom the LORD had removed before them, and committed wicked acts to provoke the LORD to anger.
They served idols, despite the LORD's command that they should not do this.
Yet the LORD testified against Israel and Judah through all the prophets and seers, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your ancestors and sent to you through my servants the prophets."
Despite this, they refused to listen and hardened their hearts, like their ancestors who did not believe in the LORD their God.
They rejected his statutes, the covenant he made with their ancestors, and the testimonies he bore against them; they followed vanity, became vain, and pursued the practices of the surrounding nations, which the LORD had commanded them not to imitate.
They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, made molten images, even two calves, created a grove, worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
They caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
As a result, the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his sight; only the tribe of Judah remained.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God but followed the practices established by Israel.
The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of plunderers until he had cast them out of his sight.
He tore Israel away from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king; Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin.
The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, and they did not turn away from them.
Until the LORD removed Israel from his sight, as he had declared through all his servants the prophets. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, and they remain there to this day.
The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the children of Israel; they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
At the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD; therefore, the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
Consequently, they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the manner of the God of the land; therefore, he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them because they do not know the manner of the God of the land."
Then the king of Assyria commanded, "Send one of the priests you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and teach them the manner of the God of the land."
So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and settled in Bethel, teaching them how they should fear the LORD.
However, each nation made gods of their own and placed them in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans had made, each nation in the cities where they lived.
The men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima.
The Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
So they feared the LORD and appointed from among the lowest of them priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
They feared the LORD but also served their own gods, following the practices of the nations from which they had been carried away.
To this day, they continue to follow the former practices; they do not fear the LORD, nor do they adhere to his statutes, ordinances, or the law and commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
With whom the LORD had made a covenant, charging them, "You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.
But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, him shall you fear, him shall you worship, and to him shall you offer sacrifices.
And the statutes, ordinances, law, and commandments that he wrote for you, you shall observe forever; you shall not fear other gods.
And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods.
But the LORD your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.
However, they did not listen but continued in their former practices.
So these nations feared the LORD and served their graven images, both their children and their children's children; as their fathers did, so they continue to this day.
