In the third year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began his reign.
He was twenty-five years old when he ascended to the throne and reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, following the example of his father David.
He removed the high places, broke the images, cut down the groves, and shattered the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until that time the children of Israel had burned incense to it; he named it Nehushtan.
He placed his trust in the LORD God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after him.
He held fast to the LORD and did not turn away from following Him, keeping the commandments that the LORD had commanded Moses.
The LORD was with him, and he prospered wherever he went; he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
He struck the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders, from the watchtower to the fortified city.
In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria and besieged it.
At the end of three years, they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, Habor by the river Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
This happened because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded; they would not listen or do them.
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
King Hezekiah of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have offended; withdraw from me: whatever you impose on me, I will bear." The king of Assyria then demanded from Hezekiah, king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
Hezekiah gave him all the silver found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house.
At that time, Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the pillars that he had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
The king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army against Jerusalem. They went up and arrived at Jerusalem, and when they reached it, they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's field.
When they called to the king, Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.
Rabshakeh said to them, "Speak now to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, 'What confidence is this in which you trust?
You say, (but they are mere empty words,) 'I have counsel and strength for war.' Now, on whom do you rely that you rebel against me?
Look, you are trusting in the staff of this bruised reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will pierce his hand; so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.
But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?
Now, therefore, I urge you to give pledges to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will deliver to you two thousand horses, if you are able to put riders on them.
How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'
Then Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall."
But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
Thus says the king, 'Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and eat each of you from his own vine and each one from his own fig tree, and drink each one the waters of his cistern,
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey, that you may live and not die; and do not listen to Hezekiah when he persuades you, saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.'
Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
Who among all the gods of the countries has delivered their country from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
But the people held their peace and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Do not answer him."
Then Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
