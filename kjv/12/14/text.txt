In the second year of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah, the son of Joash, became king of Judah.  
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.  
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father David had done; he followed the example of Joash, his father.  
However, the high places were not removed, and the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on those high places.  
As soon as the kingdom was firmly established in his hand, he executed the servants who had killed his father, the king.  
But he did not kill the children of the murderers, in accordance with what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; each shall be put to death for his own sin."  
He struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, took Selah by war, and named it Joktheel, a name it retains to this day.  
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us face each other."  
In response, Jehoash, king of Israel, sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, "The thistle in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But a wild beast passed by and trampled the thistle."  
"You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at home. Why should you meddle in trouble, so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"  
But Amaziah refused to listen. Therefore, Jehoash, king of Israel, went up, and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, faced each other at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.  
Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent.  
Jehoash, king of Israel, captured Amaziah, king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, where he broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.  
He took all the gold and silver, along with all the vessels found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house, and he took hostages, returning to Samaria.  
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, including his might and how he fought with Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  
Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; his son Jeroboam reigned in his place.  
Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.  
Are the rest of the acts of Amaziah not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
A conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.  
They brought him back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.  
All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.  
He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king had slept with his fathers.  
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam, son of Joash, began to reign in Samaria, ruling for forty-one years.  
He did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.  
He restored the borders of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah, son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher.  
For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; there was no one left, nor any helper for Israel.  
And the LORD did not say He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; instead, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, son of Joash.  
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, all that he did, his might, how he waged war, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath, which belonged to Judah for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  
Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and his son Zachariah reigned in his place.
