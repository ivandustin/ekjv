Now Naaman, the captain of the king of Syria's army, was a distinguished man in the eyes of his master and held in high regard, for through him the LORD had granted victory to Syria; he was also a valiant warrior, but he suffered from leprosy.
The Syrians had raided the land of Israel and taken captive a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman's wife.
She said to her mistress, "If only my lord were with the prophet in Samaria! He would heal him of his leprosy."
One of Naaman's attendants went in and informed him, saying, "This is what the girl from Israel said."
The king of Syria replied, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So he set out, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
He delivered the letter to the king of Israel, stating, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you so that you may heal him of his leprosy."
When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, "Am I God, able to kill and bring back to life? Why does this man send someone to me to be healed of leprosy? Consider, please, and see how he is trying to pick a fight with me."
When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."
So Naaman arrived with his horses and chariot and stopped at the entrance to Elisha's house.
Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be cleansed."
Naaman became angry and went away, saying, "I thought he would surely come out to me, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot, and cure me of my leprosy.
Are not the rivers Abana and Pharpar in Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.
His servants approached him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'?"
So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had instructed. His flesh was restored and became like that of a young boy, and he was clean.
He returned to the man of God with all his attendants and stood before him. He said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant."
But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.
Naaman then said, "If you will not, please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD.
But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down, and he leans on my arm, and I bow there as well—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant for this."
Elisha said, "Go in peace." So Naaman left him and went a short distance.
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything all right?"
Gehazi answered, "Everything is all right. My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"
"By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away, and they left.
When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.
Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, or cattle, or male and female servants?
Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Gehazi went out from Elisha's presence and his skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow.
