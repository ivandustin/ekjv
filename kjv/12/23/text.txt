And the king sent for all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to gather to him.  
The king ascended to the house of the LORD, accompanied by all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; he read aloud to them all the words of the book of the covenant found in the house of the LORD.  
Standing by a pillar, the king made a covenant before the LORD to follow Him, keeping His commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all their heart and soul, to fulfill the words of this covenant written in the book. All the people agreed to the covenant.  
The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door to remove from the temple of the LORD all the vessels made for Baal, the grove, and all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.  
He abolished the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places of Judah and around Jerusalem, including those who burned incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, the planets, and all the host of heaven.  
He removed the grove from the house of the LORD, took it outside Jerusalem to the brook Kidron, burned it there, ground it to powder, and scattered the powder on the graves of the people.  
He demolished the houses of the sodomites that were near the house of the LORD, where women wove hangings for the grove.  
He brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where they had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and tore down the high places at the gates, including those at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on the left side of the gate.  
However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem; they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.  
He defiled Topheth, located in the valley of the children of Hinnom, so that no one would make their son or daughter pass through the fire to Molech.  
He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance of the house of the LORD, near the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  
He smashed the altars on the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD; he tore them down and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.  
The high places before Jerusalem, on the right side of the mount of corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Zidonians, for Chemosh, the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom, the abomination of the children of Ammon, were defiled by the king.  
He broke the images, cut down the groves, and filled their places with human bones.  
Moreover, the altar at Bethel and the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, were both torn down; he burned the high place, ground it to powder, and burned the grove.  
As Josiah turned, he noticed the sepulchers on the mountain, sent for them, took the bones from the sepulchers, burned them on the altar, and defiled it, fulfilling the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God.  
He asked, "What is that title I see?" The men of the city replied, "It is the sepulcher of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things against the altar of Bethel."  
He said, "Leave him alone; do not disturb his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.  
He also removed all the houses of the high places in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger; Josiah dealt with them according to all the acts he had performed in Bethel.  
He killed all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars, burned human bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.  
The king commanded all the people, saying, "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant."  
Indeed, such a Passover had not been held since the days of the judges who ruled Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah.  
But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.  
Moreover, Josiah removed the workers with familiar spirits, the wizards, the images, the idols, and all the abominations found in the land of Judah and Jerusalem, to fulfill the words of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.  
There was no king like him before him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, soul, and might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any arise like him after him.  
Yet the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, which was kindled against Judah because of all the provocations that Manasseh had caused.  
The LORD said, "I will also remove Judah from My sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, 'My name shall be there.'"  
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
In his days, Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; King Josiah went against him and was slain at Megiddo when he encountered him.  
His servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. The people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father's place.  
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.  
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his fathers.  
Pharaohnechoh imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, preventing him from reigning in Jerusalem, and imposed a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold on the land.  
Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, changing his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away; he went to Egypt and died there.  
Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to raise the money according to Pharaoh's command; he exacted silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to their taxation, to give it to Pharaohnechoh.  
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.  
He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his fathers.
