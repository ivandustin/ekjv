Moab rebelled against Israel following the death of Ahab.  
Ahaziah fell through a lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and became ill; he sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, whether he would recover from his illness.  
However, the angel of the LORD instructed Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, 'Is it not because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?'"  
Therefore, the LORD declares, "You shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up; you shall surely die." And Elijah departed.  
When the messengers returned to him, he asked, "Why have you returned?"  
They replied, "A man came to meet us and said, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, Thus says the LORD: Is it not because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up; you shall surely die.'"  
He then asked them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"  
They answered, "He was a hairy man, with a leather belt around his waist." He said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite."  
Then the king sent a captain with fifty men to Elijah. When they found him sitting on top of a hill, the captain said to him, "Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down!'"  
Elijah responded to the captain, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.  
The king sent another captain with fifty men, and he said to Elijah, "O man of God, the king has said, 'Come down quickly!'"  
Elijah replied, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." The fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.  
A third captain approached, fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded, "O man of God, I pray you, let my life and the lives of these fifty servants be precious in your sight."  
"Look, fire came down from heaven and burned up the two captains of the former fifties with their men; please let my life be precious in your sight."  
The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king.  
He said to the king, "Thus says the LORD: Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore, you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up; you shall surely die."  
So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram reigned in his place in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because he had no son.  
Now, are not the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
