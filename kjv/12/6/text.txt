And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Behold, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us.  
Let us go, we pray, to the Jordan, and let each of us take a beam from there, and let us make a place for ourselves where we may dwell." And he answered, "Go."  
One of them said, "Please be willing to go with your servants." And he replied, "I will go."  
So he went with them, and when they arrived at the Jordan, they began to cut down trees.  
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, "Alas, master! It was borrowed!"  
The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place, and Elisha cut a stick and threw it in there, and the iron floated.  
Elisha then said, "Take it up for yourself." So he reached out his hand and took it.  
Then the king of Syria waged war against Israel and consulted with his servants, saying, "In such and such a place shall be my camp."  
The man of God sent a message to the king of Israel, saying, "Beware that you do not pass that place, for the Syrians are coming down there."  
The king of Israel sent to the place that the man of God had warned him about, and he saved himself there, not just once or twice.  
Therefore, the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this, and he called his servants and asked them, "Will you not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?"  
One of his servants replied, "None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."  
He said, "Go and spy where he is, that I may send and capture him." It was reported to him, "Behold, he is in Dothan."  
So he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.  
When the servant of the man of God rose early and went out, behold, an army surrounded the city with horses and chariots. His servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"  
He answered, "Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."  
Elisha prayed and said, "LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see." The LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.  
When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, "Strike this people with blindness, I pray." And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.  
Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man you seek." But he led them to Samaria.  
When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see." The LORD opened their eyes, and they saw that they were in the midst of Samaria.  
The king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, "My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?"  
He answered, "You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Set bread and water before them so they may eat and drink and go to their master."  
He prepared a great feast for them, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria did not come again into the land of Israel.  
After this, Benhadad, king of Syria, gathered all his forces and went up and besieged Samaria.  
There was a great famine in Samaria, and indeed, they besieged it until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a quarter of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.  
As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, "Help, my lord, O king!"  
He replied, "If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?"  
The king asked her, "What is the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son so we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'"  
So we boiled my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, 'Give your son so we may eat him,' but she has hidden her son."  
When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes, and as he walked along the wall, the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body.  
Then he said, "May God do so to me and more also if the head of Elisha, son of Shaphat, remains on him today."  
But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"  
While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, "Behold, this evil is from the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
