In the seventeenth year of Pekah, son of Remaliah, Ahaz, son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.  
Ahaz was twenty years old when he ascended to the throne and reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, unlike his ancestor David.  
Instead, he followed the practices of the kings of Israel and even made his son pass through the fire, imitating the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.  
He also sacrificed and burned incense at the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.  
At that time, Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war; they besieged Ahaz but were unable to conquer him.  
During this period, Rezin, king of Syria, reclaimed Elath for Syria and expelled the Jews from Elath; the Syrians settled there and continue to dwell there to this day.  
Consequently, Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son; come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising against me."  
Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's palace and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.  
The king of Assyria listened to him; he marched against Damascus, captured it, carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.  
King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria, and saw an altar there; he sent to Urijah the priest the design and pattern of the altar, along with all its craftsmanship.  
Urijah the priest constructed an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, and he made it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.  
When the king arrived from Damascus, he saw the altar and approached it to offer sacrifices.  
He burned his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.  
He also brought the bronze altar, which was before the LORD, from the front of the house, between the altar and the house of the LORD, and placed it on the north side of the altar.  
King Ahaz instructed Urijah the priest, saying, "On the great altar, burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king's burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, along with the burnt offerings of all the people of the land, their grain offerings, and their drink offerings; sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the blood of the sacrifices. The bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by."  
Urijah the priest acted according to all that King Ahaz commanded.  
King Ahaz removed the borders of the bases, took the laver off them, dismantled the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and placed it on a pavement of stones.  
He also turned away the covered area for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, from the house of the LORD, for the king of Assyria.  
Now, the rest of the acts of Ahaz, which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  
Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David; his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
