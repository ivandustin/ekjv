When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she rose up and exterminated all the royal descendants.
However, Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and rescued him from among the slain king's sons; they hid him and his nurse in the bedchamber to protect him from Athaliah, ensuring he was not killed.
He remained hidden with her in the house of the LORD for six years, while Athaliah ruled over the land.
In the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the commanders of hundreds, along with the captains and the guards, and brought them to the house of the LORD, where he made a covenant with them and took an oath in the house of the LORD, showing them the king's son.
He instructed them, saying, "This is what you shall do: One-third of you who enter on the Sabbath shall be in charge of guarding the king's house;
another third shall be at the gate of Sur, and the remaining third at the gate behind the guard. This way, you will maintain the watch of the house, preventing it from being breached.
And two-thirds of you who go out on the Sabbath shall keep watch over the house of the LORD around the king.
You shall surround the king, each man with his weapon in hand; anyone who approaches the designated area shall be killed. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in."
The captains of the hundreds complied with all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: each man took his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, along with those who would go out, and they came to Jehoiada the priest.
The priest provided the captains of hundreds with King David's spears and shields, which were kept in the temple of the LORD.
The guards stood, each man armed, surrounding the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner, alongside the altar and the temple.
He brought forth the king's son, placed the crown upon him, and presented him with the testimony; they made him king, anointed him, and the people clapped their hands, proclaiming, "God save the king!"
When Athaliah heard the commotion of the guards and the people, she approached them in the temple of the LORD.
Upon seeing the scene, she beheld the king standing by a pillar, as was customary, with the princes and trumpeters beside him, and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
But Jehoiada the priest instructed the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, saying, "Take her out from the designated area, and anyone who follows her should be killed with the sword." For the priest had declared, "Do not let her be slain in the house of the LORD."
They seized her, and she went by the way that the horses entered the king's house, where she was executed.
Jehoiada established a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people, affirming that they would be the LORD's people; he also made a covenant between the king and the people.
All the people of the land entered the house of Baal and demolished it; they thoroughly broke down his altars and images, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
He gathered the commanders of hundreds, the captains, the guards, and all the people of the land; they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered by the gate of the guards to the king's house, where he sat on the throne of the kings.
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at peace; they executed Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.
Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
