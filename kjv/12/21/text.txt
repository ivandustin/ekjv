Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
He committed evil in the sight of the LORD, following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had expelled before the children of Israel.
He rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah, his father, had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done; he worshipped all the host of heaven and served them.
He constructed altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem, I will put my name."
He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
He made his son pass through the fire, practiced divination, used enchantments, and consulted with familiar spirits and wizards; he committed much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.
He set up a carved image of the Asherah pole he had made in the house, of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever."
"I will not again remove the feet of Israel from the land that I gave to their fathers, provided they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them."
But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
The LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,
"Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has committed these abominations and has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has caused Judah to sin with his idols:
Therefore, thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle.'
I will measure against Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
because they have done what is evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this day."
Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, filling Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin he caused Judah to commit by doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, all that he did, and his sin that he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and his son Amon reigned in his place.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
He committed evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Manasseh had done.
He walked in all the ways that his father walked in, served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them.
He forsook the LORD God of his fathers and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.
The people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah reigned in his place.
