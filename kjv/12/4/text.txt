A certain woman from the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant, my husband, is dead; and you know that your servant feared the LORD. Now the creditor has come to take my two sons as bondmen."
Elisha asked her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" She replied, "Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a pot of oil."
He instructed her, "Go, borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels; do not borrow a few."
"When you come in, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour the oil into all those vessels, setting aside the full ones."
So she went from him, shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her, and she poured out the oil.
When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." He replied, "There is not another vessel." And the oil stopped flowing.
She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil, pay your debt, and you and your children can live on the rest."
One day, Elisha passed through Shunem, where a prominent woman lived. She urged him to eat bread, and whenever he passed by, he would stop there to eat.
She said to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God who continually passes by us."
"Let us make a small room on the roof and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. When he comes to us, he can stay there."
One day, he came to the room and lay down there.
He said to Gehazi, his servant, "Call this Shunammite." When he called her, she stood before him.
He asked Gehazi, "Tell her, you have taken such good care of us; what can we do for you? Would you like me to speak to the king or the commander of the army?" She answered, "I dwell among my own people."
"What then can be done for her?" Gehazi replied, "She has no son, and her husband is old."
He said, "Call her." When she came in, she stood at the door.
He said, "About this time next year, you will embrace a son." She said, "No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your maidservant."
But the woman conceived and bore a son at the appointed time, as Elisha had said.
When the child grew, one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.
He said to his father, "My head, my head!" The father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."
When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then he died.
She went up, laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door, and went out.
She called to her husband, "Send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, so I can run to the man of God and come back."
He asked, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath." She said, "It will be well."
Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, "Drive and go forward; do not slow down for me unless I tell you."
So she went and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to Gehazi, "Look, there is the Shunammite."
"Run to meet her and ask her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'" She answered, "It is well."
When she reached the man of God on the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. The man of God said, "Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me."
She said, "Did I ask for a son, my lord? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?"
He said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Lay my staff on the face of the child."
The mother of the child said, "As the LORD lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So he arose and followed her.
Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the child's face, but there was neither voice nor hearing. He returned to meet Elisha and said, "The child has not awakened."
When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child dead on his bed.
He went in, shut the door behind them both, and prayed to the LORD.
He went up, lay on the child, putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. As he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm.
He returned and walked in the house back and forth, then went up and stretched himself upon him again. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
He called Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her, and when she came in, he said, "Take up your son."
She went in, fell at his feet, bowed to the ground, and took up her son and went out.
Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook stew for the sons of the prophets."
One went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered wild gourds and filled his lap, then came and sliced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what they were.
They poured out the stew for the men to eat, but as they were eating, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" They could not eat it.
But he said, "Bring flour." He threw it into the pot and said, "Pour out for the people that they may eat." There was no harm in the pot.
A man came from Baalshalisha, bringing the man of God bread from the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh grain in the husk. He said, "Give it to the people so they may eat."
His servant said, "What, should I set this before a hundred men?" He said again, "Give it to the people so they may eat, for thus says the LORD: They shall eat and have some left over."
So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.
