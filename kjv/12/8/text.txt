Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had brought back to life, saying, "Arise, go with your household, and stay wherever you can, for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for seven years."
The woman arose and did as the man of God instructed; she went with her household and stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
At the end of the seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to cry out to the king for her house and her land.
The king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, asking, "Tell me, please, all the great things that Elisha has done."
As Gehazi was recounting to the king how Elisha had restored a dead body to life, the woman whose son had been restored cried out to the king for her house and her land. Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
When the king asked the woman, she told him her story. The king then appointed a certain officer, saying, "Restore all that was hers, and all the produce of the field since the day she left the land, even until now."
Elisha came to Damascus, and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was sick. It was reported to him, "The man of God has come here."
The king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand, go meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, 'Shall I recover from this disease?'"
So Hazael went to meet him, taking a gift of every good thing from Damascus, a burden of forty camels, and he stood before Elisha, saying, "Your son Benhadad, king of Syria, has sent me to you, asking, 'Shall I recover from this disease?'"
Elisha said to him, "Go, tell him, 'You may certainly recover,' but the LORD has shown me that he will surely die."
Hazael fixed his gaze steadily until he felt ashamed, and the man of God wept.
Hazael asked, "Why does my lord weep?" Elisha replied, "Because I know the evil you will do to the children of Israel: you will set their strongholds on fire, kill their young men with the sword, dash their children, and rip open their pregnant women."
Hazael said, "But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Syria."
Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, "What did Elisha say to you?" He replied, "He told me that you would surely recover."
The next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king's face, so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.
In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, and Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for the sake of David, His servant, as He promised to give him a lamp and his children forever.
During his reign, Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and appointed a king for themselves.
So Joram went to Zair with all his chariots; he rose by night and struck down the Edomites who had surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots, and the people fled into their tents.
Yet Edom has revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. At the same time, Libnah revolted.
The rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
Joram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David; his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.
In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
He joined Joram, the son of Ahab, in battle against Hazael, king of Syria, at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.
King Joram returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah, while he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel because he was sick.
