Then Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the LORD, tomorrow at this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria."

Then a lord, on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, saying, "Behold, if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this thing happen?" Elisha replied, "Behold, you shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."

There were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die?"

If we say, "We will enter the city," the famine is in the city, and we will die there; and if we sit here, we will also die. Therefore, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians: if they spare our lives, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.

They rose up at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians, and when they reached the outskirts of the camp, behold, there was no one there.

For the LORD had caused the host of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, even the sound of a great army. They said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us."

So they arose and fled in the twilight, leaving their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, and fled for their lives.

When these lepers reached the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they returned, entered another tent, and carried away more, and hid it as well.

Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right: this day is a day of good news, and we are keeping silent. If we wait until morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king's household."

So they came and called to the gatekeeper of the city, and they told him, saying, "We went to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one there, nor any voice of man; only horses tied and donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."

He called the porters, and they reported it to the king's household.

The king arose in the night and said to his servants, "I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know we are hungry; therefore, they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall capture them alive and get into the city.'"

One of his servants answered and said, "Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are like all the multitude of the Israelites that are perishing), and let us send and see."

So they took two chariot horses, and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see."

They went after them to the Jordan, and lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. The messengers returned and told the king.

The people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, just as the word of the LORD had said.

The king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.

And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow at this time at the gate of Samaria."

That lord answered the man of God, saying, "Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could such a thing happen?" Elisha replied, "Behold, you shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."

And so it happened to him: for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
