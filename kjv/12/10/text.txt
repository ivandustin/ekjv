And Ahab had seventy sons residing in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and those who raised Ahab's children, saying,
"As soon as this letter reaches you, know that your master's sons are with you, along with chariots, horses, a fortified city, and armor.
Choose the best and most suitable of your master's sons, set him on his father's throne, and defend your master's house."
However, they were extremely afraid and said, "Behold, two kings could not stand before him; how then can we?"
The one in charge of the house, the one in charge of the city, the elders, and the caretakers of the children sent a message to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants and will do all that you command; we will not appoint a king. Do what is good in your eyes."
Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying, "If you are mine and will listen to my voice, take the heads of your master's sons and bring them to me in Jezreel by tomorrow at this time." The king's sons, numbering seventy, were with the prominent men of the city who raised them.
When the letter arrived, they took the king's sons, killed seventy of them, placed their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
A messenger came and informed him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." He replied, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning."
In the morning, he went out, stood, and said to all the people, "You are righteous; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?"
"Know that nothing of the word of the LORD concerning the house of Ahab will fall to the ground, for the LORD has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah."
So Jehu killed all that remained of Ahab's house in Jezreel, along with all his great men, relatives, and priests, leaving none remaining.
He then arose and departed, coming to Samaria. While he was at the shearing house along the way,
Jehu encountered the brothers of Ahaziah, king of Judah, and asked, "Who are you?" They answered, "We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen."
He said, "Take them alive." They took them alive and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men; he left none of them alive.
After departing from there, he met Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him. He greeted him and asked, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" Jehonadab replied, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." He gave him his hand, and Jehu took him up into the chariot.
He said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." So they made him ride in his chariot.
When he arrived in Samaria, he killed all that remained of Ahab's house in Samaria, fulfilling the word of the LORD that He spoke to Elijah.
Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
Now, therefore, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu did this cunningly, intending to destroy the worshippers of Baal.
Jehu said, "Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal." They proclaimed it.
Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that not a single man was left out. They entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
He said to the one in charge of the vestry, "Bring out vestments for all the worshippers of Baal." He brought out the vestments.
Jehu and Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, entered the house of Baal and said to the worshippers of Baal, "Search and see that there are no servants of the LORD here, but only worshippers of Baal."
When they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men outside and said, "If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, the one who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him."
As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and captains, "Go in and kill them; let none escape." They struck them down with the sword, and the guards and captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of Baal.
They brought out the images from the house of Baal and burned them.
They broke down the image of Baal, tore down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.
Thus, Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.
However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, specifically the golden calves in Bethel and Dan.
The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in executing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in my heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."
But Jehu did not take care to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which caused Israel to sin.
In those days, the LORD began to reduce Israel, and Hazael struck them in all the territories of Israel;
From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
Jehu slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.
The duration of Jehu's reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
