And Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets, instructing him, "Prepare yourself, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead.  
When you arrive there, look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in, and bring him away from his companions to an inner chamber.  
Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and declare, 'Thus says the LORD: I have anointed you king over Israel.' After that, open the door and flee; do not linger."  
So the young prophet went to Ramothgilead.  
Upon his arrival, he found the captains of the army sitting there. He said, "I have a message for you, O captain." Jehu replied, "For which of us?" He answered, "For you, O captain."  
Jehu rose and entered the house. The young prophet poured the oil on his head and said to him, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.  
You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD at the hand of Jezebel.  
For the entire house of Ahab shall perish; I will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free, in Israel.  
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.  
And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one shall bury her." He then opened the door and fled.  
Jehu came out to the servants of his lord, and one asked him, "Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?" He replied, "You know the man and his talk."  
They said, "It is false; tell us now." He said, "This is what he said to me: 'Thus says the LORD: I have anointed you king over Israel.'"  
Then they hurried, each man taking off his garment and laying it under him on the top of the stairs, and they blew the trumpets, proclaiming, "Jehu is king!"  
So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael, king of Syria.  
But King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds inflicted by the Syrians when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria.) Jehu said, "If you are in agreement, let no one escape the city to go and tell it in Jezreel."  
Jehu then rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was there. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to visit Joram.  
A watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu approaching. He reported, "I see a company." Joram said, "Send a horseman to meet them and ask, 'Is it peace?'"  
So a horseman rode out to meet him and said, "Thus says the king: Is it peace?" Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and follow me." The watchman reported, "The messenger has reached them, but he is not returning."  
Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "Thus says the king: Is it peace?" Jehu answered, "What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and follow me."  
The watchman reported, "He went to them and is not returning; the driving is like the driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously."  
Joram said, "Make ready." His chariot was prepared, and Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, to confront Jehu in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.  
When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is it peace, Jehu?" Jehu replied, "What peace can there be as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so numerous?"  
Joram turned his back and fled, saying to Ahaziah, "There is treachery, O Ahaziah!"  
Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Joram between the shoulders; the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.  
Jehu then said to Bidkar, his captain, "Pick him up and throw him into the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember how, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD pronounced this judgment upon him:  
'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,' says the LORD, 'and I will repay you in this plot,' says the LORD. Now therefore, take him and cast him into the plot of ground, according to the word of the LORD."  
When Ahaziah, king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and said, "Strike him down in the chariot." They did so at the ascent of Gur, which is near Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo and died there.  
His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David.  
In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.  
When Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked out through a window.  
As Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?"  
He lifted his face to the window and asked, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.  
He commanded, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her underfoot.  
When he went in, he ate and drank, and said, "Go, see this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter."  
They went to bury her, but found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands.  
When they returned and told him, he said, "This is the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'In the territory of Jezreel, dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.  
And the carcass of Jezebel shall be like refuse on the ground in the territory of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, 'This is Jezebel.'"
