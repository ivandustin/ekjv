In the days when the judges ruled, a famine arose in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live temporarily in the country of Moab, along with his wife and two sons.  
The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and their two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They entered the country of Moab and settled there.  
Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, leaving her and her two sons behind.  
The sons took Moabite wives; one was named Orpah and the other Ruth, and they lived there for about ten years.  
Both Mahlon and Chilion also died, leaving Naomi without her two sons and her husband.  
Then Naomi decided to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard that the LORD had provided food for His people.  
So she set out from the place where she had been living, accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, and they began their journey back to the land of Judah.  
Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's house. May the LORD show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to the dead and to me."  
"May the LORD grant that each of you find rest in the home of another husband." She kissed them, and they wept aloud.  
They said to her, "We will go back with you to your people."  
But Naomi replied, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?  
Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me, even if I had a husband tonight and gave birth to sons,  
would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters; it is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has turned against me."  
At this they wept again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.  
Naomi said, "Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."  
But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go, I will go, and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.  
Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me."  
When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.  
So the two of them traveled until they arrived in Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"  
"Don't call me Naomi," she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.  
I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me."  
So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
