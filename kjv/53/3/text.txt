Finally, dear brothers, please pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it is among you.  
And that we may be rescued from unreasonable and wicked individuals, for not everyone has faith.  
But the Lord is faithful; He will strengthen you and protect you from evil.  
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both are doing and will continue to do the things we command you.  
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.  
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother who lives irresponsibly and does not follow the tradition we passed on to you.  
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us; we were not disorderly among you.  
Nor did we eat anyone's food without paying; instead, we worked hard and toiled night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you.  
Not because we do not have the right, but to set an example for you to follow.  
For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: If anyone is unwilling to work, let him not eat.  
For we hear that some among you are living irresponsibly, not working at all, but being busybodies.  
Now we command and encourage such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own living.  
But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.  
And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may feel ashamed.  
Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.  
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.  
This greeting is in my own hand, Paul, which is the mark in every letter; this is how I write.  
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
