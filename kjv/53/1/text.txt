Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  
Grace and peace be with you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
We are always grateful to God for you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of each one of you for one another is increasing;  
So that we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all the persecutions and tribulations you endure:  
This is a clear sign of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:  
Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay tribulation to those who trouble you;  
And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,  
In flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  
They will be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power;  
When he comes to be glorified in his saints and to be admired among all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed) on that day.  
Therefore, we also pray always for you, that our God would make you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power:  
That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
