And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Take Aaron and his sons with him, along with the garments, the anointing oil, a bull for the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;  
Gather all the congregation together at the entrance of the tabernacle.  
Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance of the tabernacle.  
Moses said to the congregation, 'This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.'  
Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.  
He put the coat on Aaron, girded him with the girdle, clothed him with the robe, placed the ephod on him, and girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, binding it to him.  
He placed the breastplate on him, and in the breastplate, he put the Urim and the Thummim.  
He set the mitre on his head, and on the mitre's forefront, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, sanctifying them.  
He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its vessels, including the laver and its base, to sanctify them.  
He poured the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him.  
Moses brought Aaron's sons, put coats on them, girded them with girdles, and placed bonnets on them, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
He brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull.  
He killed it, and Moses took the blood, applied it to the horns of the altar all around with his finger, purified the altar, poured the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it to make atonement for it.  
He took all the fat from the innards, the caul above the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned it on the altar.  
But the bull, along with its hide, flesh, and dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
He brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  
He killed it, and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.  
He cut the ram into pieces; Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.  
He washed the innards and the legs in water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice, a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
He brought the other ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  
He killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot.  
He brought Aaron's sons, and Moses applied the blood to the tips of their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the big toes of their right feet; Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.  
He took the fat, the rump, all the fat from the innards, the caul above the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right shoulder.  
From the basket of unleavened bread before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, placing them on the fat and the right shoulder.  
He placed all of this on Aaron's hands and his sons' hands, and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.  
Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering: they were consecrations, a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses' part from the ram of consecration, as the LORD commanded Moses.  
Moses took some of the anointing oil and the blood from the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, his garments, his sons, and their garments with him; thus he sanctified Aaron, his garments, his sons, and their garments.  
Moses said to Aaron and his sons, 'Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tabernacle and eat it with the bread in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'  
What remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.  
You shall not leave the entrance of the tabernacle for seven days, until the days of your consecration are complete; for seven days he shall consecrate you.  
As he has done today, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.  
Therefore, you shall remain at the entrance of the tabernacle day and night for seven days, keeping the charge of the LORD, so that you do not die; for so I am commanded.  
So Aaron and his sons did all that the LORD commanded through Moses.
