And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses summoned Aaron and his sons, along with the elders of Israel.
He instructed Aaron to take a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and to present them before the LORD.
To the children of Israel, he said, "Take a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without blemish, for a burnt offering."
Additionally, he instructed them to bring a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, along with a meat offering mixed with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.
They brought what Moses commanded to the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the congregation approached and stood before the LORD.
Moses declared, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, and the glory of the LORD will appear to you."
He then told Aaron, "Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, make atonement for yourself and for the people, and offer the people's offering, making atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded."
Aaron went to the altar and sacrificed the calf of the sin offering for himself.
Aaron's sons brought the blood to him; he dipped his finger in the blood, applied it to the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
The fat, kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
The flesh and hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
He then sacrificed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, which he sprinkled around the altar.
They presented the burnt offering to him, along with its pieces and the head, which he burned on the altar.
He washed the inwards and legs and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.
He brought the people's offering, took the goat that was the sin offering for the people, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, just as he had done before.
He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the prescribed manner.
He brought the meat offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, alongside the morning's burnt sacrifice.
He also slaughtered the bullock and the ram for peace offerings for the people, and Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, which he sprinkled around the altar.
He placed the fat of the bullock and ram, including the rump, the covering of the inwards, the kidneys, and the caul above the liver, on the altar.
They placed the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.
Aaron waved the breasts and the right shoulder as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.
Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
Moses and Aaron entered the tabernacle of the congregation, came out, and blessed the people; the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
A fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar; when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
