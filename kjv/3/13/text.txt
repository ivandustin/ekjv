And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  
When a man has a rising, a scab, or a bright spot on the skin of his flesh, resembling the plague of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or one of his sons, the priests.  
The priest shall examine the plague on the skin of the flesh; if the hair in the plague has turned white and the plague appears deeper than the skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and the priest shall declare him unclean.  
If the bright spot is white on the skin of his flesh, not deeper than the skin, and the hair has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the one with the plague for seven days.  
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine him again; if the plague has not changed and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall isolate him for another seven days.  
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine him again; if the plague appears somewhat dark and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall declare him clean, for it is just a scab. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.  
However, if the scab spreads significantly on the skin after he has been examined by the priest for cleansing, he shall be examined by the priest again.  
If the priest sees that the scab has spread on the skin, he shall declare him unclean, for it is leprosy.  
When a man has leprosy, he shall be brought to the priest;  
The priest shall examine him; if the rising is white on the skin, has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising,  
It is an old leprosy on the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall declare him unclean and shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.  
If leprosy breaks out on the skin and covers all the skin of the one with the plague from head to foot, wherever the priest looks,  
Then the priest shall consider; if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall declare the one with the plague clean, for it is all turned white; he is clean.  
But if raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.  
The priest shall examine the raw flesh and declare him unclean, for the raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.  
If the raw flesh turns back to white, he shall come to the priest;  
The priest shall examine him; if the plague has turned white, the priest shall declare him clean; he is clean.  
If there was a boil in the flesh, and it has healed,  
And in the place of the boil, there is a white rising or a bright spot, white and somewhat reddish, and it is shown to the priest;  
If the priest sees it and it is lower than the skin, and the hair has turned white, the priest shall declare him unclean, for it is a plague of leprosy that has broken out from the boil.  
But if the priest examines it and sees no white hairs and it is not lower than the skin but somewhat dark, the priest shall isolate him for seven days.  
If it spreads significantly on the skin, the priest shall declare him unclean, for it is a plague.  
But if the bright spot remains in place and does not spread, it is a burning boil, and the priest shall declare him clean.  
If there is any flesh on the skin that has a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burns has a white bright spot, somewhat reddish or white;  
Then the priest shall examine it; if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, it is a leprosy that has broken out from the burning; therefore, the priest shall declare him unclean, for it is the plague of leprosy.  
But if the priest examines it and sees no white hair in the bright spot, and it is not lower than the other skin but somewhat dark, the priest shall isolate him for seven days.  
The priest shall examine him on the seventh day; if it has spread significantly on the skin, the priest shall declare him unclean, for it is the plague of leprosy.  
If the bright spot remains in place and does not spread on the skin but is somewhat dark, it is a rising from the burning, and the priest shall declare him clean, for it is an inflammation from the burning.  
If a man or woman has a plague on the head or beard;  
Then the priest shall examine the plague; if it appears deeper than the skin and has yellow thin hair, the priest shall declare him unclean, for it is a dry scall, even a leprosy on the head or beard.  
If the priest examines the plague of the scall and sees it is not deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the one with the plague of the scall for seven days.  
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the plague; if the scall has not spread, there is no yellow hair, and the scall is not deeper than the skin;  
He shall be shaved, but the scall shall not be shaved; the priest shall isolate the one with the scall for another seven days.  
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the scall; if it has not spread on the skin and is not deeper than the skin, the priest shall declare him clean, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.  
But if the scall spreads significantly on the skin after his cleansing;  
Then the priest shall examine him; if the scall has spread on the skin, the priest shall not look for yellow hair; he is unclean.  
If the scall remains in place and there is black hair grown in it, the scall is healed; he is clean, and the priest shall declare him clean.  
If a man or woman has bright spots on the skin of their flesh, even white bright spots;  
Then the priest shall examine; if the bright spots on the skin of their flesh are darkish white, it is a freckled spot that grows on the skin; he is clean.  
And a man whose hair has fallen off his head is bald; yet he is clean.  
And he who has hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face is forehead bald; yet he is clean.  
If there is a white reddish sore on the bald head or bald forehead, it is a leprosy that has sprung up in his bald head or bald forehead.  
Then the priest shall examine it; if the rising of the sore is white reddish in his bald head or bald forehead, as leprosy appears on the skin of the flesh;  
He is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall declare him utterly unclean; his plague is on his head.  
The leper with the plague shall have his clothes torn, his head bare, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, "Unclean, unclean."  
All the days the plague is in him, he shall be defiled; he is unclean. He shall dwell alone; his habitation shall be outside the camp.  
The garment that has the plague of leprosy, whether it is a woolen or linen garment;  
Whether it is in the warp or woof, of linen or wool, or in a skin or anything made of skin;  
If the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shown to the priest.  
The priest shall examine the plague and isolate the one with the plague for seven days.  
He shall examine the plague on the seventh day; if the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp or woof, or in a skin or in any work made of skin, the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.  
Therefore, he shall burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or linen, or anything of skin, where the plague is, for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.  
If the priest examines it and sees that the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or woof, or in anything of skin;  
Then the priest shall command that it be washed, and he shall isolate it for another seven days.  
The priest shall examine the plague after it has been washed; if the plague has not changed color and has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, for it is fret inward, whether bare within or without.  
If the priest examines it and sees that the plague is somewhat dark after washing, he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.  
If it still appears in the garment, either in the warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is a spreading plague; you shall burn that in which the plague is with fire.  
The garment, whether warp or woof, or any skin item that you wash, if the plague has departed from them, shall be washed a second time and shall be clean.  
This is the law regarding the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything of skins, to declare it clean or unclean.
