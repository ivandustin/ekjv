And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Command the children of Israel to bring you pure olive oil, beaten for the light, to ensure the lamps burn continually.  
Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, Aaron shall tend to it from evening until morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a perpetual statute for your generations.  
He shall arrange the lamps on the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.  
You shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes from it: two-tenth deals shall be in each cake.  
You shall set them in two rows, six in each row, on the pure table before the LORD.  
You shall place pure frankincense on each row, so that it may serve as a memorial for the bread, an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
Every Sabbath, he shall arrange it before the LORD continually, taken from the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant.  
It shall belong to Aaron and his sons; they shall eat it in the holy place, for it is most holy to him from the offerings of the LORD made by fire, by a perpetual statute.  
And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel quarreled in the camp.  
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the name of the LORD and cursed. They brought him to Moses: (his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)  
They put him in custody, so that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Bring out the one who has cursed outside the camp; let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let the entire congregation stone him.  
And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.  
And he who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death; the entire congregation shall certainly stone him: both the stranger and the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the name of the LORD.  
And he who kills any man shall surely be put to death.  
And he who kills a beast shall make restitution; beast for beast.  
And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him;  
Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.  
And he who kills a beast shall restore it; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.  
You shall have one manner of law, for the stranger as well as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.  
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel that they should bring out the one who had cursed from the camp and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
