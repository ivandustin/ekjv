And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male child, she shall be unclean for seven days; as during the days of her separation for her infirmity, she shall remain unclean.  
On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.  
She shall then continue in the blood of her purification for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor enter the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are fulfilled.  
But if she gives birth to a female child, she shall be unclean for two weeks, as during her separation, and she shall continue in the blood of her purification for sixty-six days.  
When the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest.  
The priest shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her who has given birth to a male or a female.  
If she is unable to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons; one for the burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.'‚Äù
