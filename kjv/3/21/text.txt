And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and tell them, 'None shall be defiled for the dead among their people.
However, for his close relatives—his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother—he may be defiled.
And for his virgin sister, who is near to him and has not had a husband, he may be defiled for her.
But he must not defile himself as a leader among his people, thereby profaning himself.
They must not shave their heads bald, nor trim the edges of their beards, nor make cuts in their flesh.
They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the fire offerings of the LORD and the bread of their God; therefore, they shall be holy.
They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute or profane, nor shall they take a divorced woman, for he is holy to his God.
You shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you, for I, the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.
If the daughter of any priest profanes herself by becoming a prostitute, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
The high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who is consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head or tear his clothes.
He shall not go near any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or mother.
He shall not leave the sanctuary or profane the sanctuary of his God, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him; I am the LORD.
He shall take a wife in her virginity.
He shall not take a widow, a divorced woman, a profane woman, or a harlot; he shall take a virgin from his own people as his wife.
He shall not profane his offspring among his people, for I, the LORD, sanctify him.'
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to Aaron, saying, 'Whoever he is of your descendants in their generations who has any blemish shall not approach to offer the bread of his God.
For any man who has a blemish shall not approach: a blind man, a lame man, one with a flat nose, or any superfluous limb,
or a man who is broken-footed or broken-handed,
or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a blemish in his eye, or is scabby, or has a broken testicle.
No man of the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire; he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy.
However, he shall not go into the veil or come near the altar, because he has a blemish, so that he does not profane my sanctuaries; for I, the LORD, sanctify them.'
And Moses told this to Aaron, his sons, and all the children of Israel."
