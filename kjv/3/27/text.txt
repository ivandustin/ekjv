And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When a man makes a special vow, the persons involved shall be valued for the LORD according to your estimation.  
Your estimation for a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, based on the shekel of the sanctuary.  
If it is a female, your estimation shall be thirty shekels.  
For those aged five to twenty years, the estimation for a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.  
For those aged one month to five years, the estimation for a male shall be five shekels of silver, and for a female, three shekels of silver.  
For those aged sixty years and above, the estimation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.  
If he is poorer than your estimation, he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall assess him; according to the ability of the one who made the vow, the priest shall determine his value.  
If it is an animal that men bring as an offering to the LORD, everything that anyone gives of such to the LORD shall be considered holy.  
He shall not alter it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he does change one animal for another, both it and the exchange shall be holy.  
If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, he shall present the animal before the priest.  
The priest shall assess it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, assess it, so shall it be.  
If he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth part of its value to your estimation.  
When a man sanctifies his house to be holy to the LORD, the priest shall assess it, whether it is good or bad; as the priest assesses it, so shall it stand.  
If the one who sanctified it wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.  
If a man sanctifies a portion of a field from his possession to the LORD, your estimation shall be based on its seed: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.  
If he sanctifies his field during the year of Jubilee, it shall stand according to your estimation.  
But if he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, the priest shall calculate the value based on the years remaining until the Jubilee, and it shall be reduced from your estimation.  
If the one who sanctified the field wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.  
If he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any longer.  
However, the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; its possession shall belong to the priest.  
If a man sanctifies to the LORD a field he has bought, which is not part of the fields of his possession,  
the priest shall calculate its worth according to your estimation, up to the year of the Jubilee; and he shall give your estimation on that day as a holy offering to the LORD.  
In the year of the Jubilee, the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought, to the one to whom the possession of the land belonged.  
All your estimations shall be based on the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.  
Only the firstborn of the animals, which should be the LORD's firstborn, no man shall sanctify; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD's.  
If it is an unclean animal, he shall redeem it according to your estimation and add a fifth part to it; or if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to your estimation.  
Nevertheless, no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD from all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.  
None of the devoted things that are devoted by men shall be redeemed; they shall surely be put to death.  
All the tithe of the land, whether from the seed of the land or from the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD.  
If a man wishes to redeem any of his tithes, he shall add a fifth part to it.  
Regarding the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.  
He shall not check whether it is good or bad, nor shall he change it; and if he changes it at all, both it and the change shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.  
These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai."
