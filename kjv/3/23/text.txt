And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them regarding the feasts of the LORD, which you shall declare to be holy convocations; these are my feasts.
For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no work on it: it is the Sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
These are the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations that you shall proclaim in their seasons.
On the fourteenth day of the first month at evening is the LORD's Passover.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD: for seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
On the first day, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work on it.
But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD for seven days; on the seventh day, there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work on it.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them, when you come into the land that I give to you, and reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.
And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the day after the Sabbath, the priest shall wave it.
And you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf a male lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering to the LORD.
And the grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD for a sweet aroma; and the drink offering shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin.
And you shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh ears until the same day that you have brought an offering to your God; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed.
Until the day after the seventh Sabbath, you shall count fifty days; and you shall offer a new grain offering to the LORD.
You shall bring from your dwellings two wave loaves of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the firstfruits to the LORD.
And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, one young bull, and two rams; they shall be for a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire, of sweet aroma to the LORD.
Then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a peace offering.
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
And you shall proclaim on the same day that it may be a holy convocation for you; you shall do no servile work on it; it shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely harvest the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a Sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
You shall do no servile work on it; but you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Also on the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you; and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
And you shall do no work on that day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
For any person who is not afflicted on that day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
And any person who does any work on that day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
You shall do no work at all; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
It shall be to you a Sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall celebrate your Sabbath.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.
On the first day, there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work on it.
For seven days, you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD; on the eighth day, there shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD; it is a solemn assembly, and you shall do no servile work on it.
These are the feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, a grain offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, everything on its day:
In addition to the Sabbaths of the LORD, and in addition to your gifts, and in addition to all your vows, and in addition to all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
Also, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD for seven days; on the first day, there shall be a Sabbath, and on the eighth day, there shall be a Sabbath.
And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
And you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
You shall dwell in booths for seven days; all who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths:
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
And Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD."
