And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
If a person sins and commits a trespass against the LORD, lying to their neighbor about what was entrusted to them, or in fellowship, or in something taken by force, or deceiving their neighbor;
Or if they find something lost and lie about it, swearing falsely; in any of these actions that a person commits, sinning in them:
Then it shall be, because they have sinned and are guilty, that they must restore what they took by force, or what they have deceitfully acquired, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost item they found,
Or all that about which they have sworn falsely; they must restore it in full, adding a fifth part more to it, and give it to the rightful owner on the day of their trespass offering.
And they shall bring their trespass offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation, as a trespass offering, to the priest:
And the priest shall make atonement for them before the LORD, and it shall be forgiven for anything they have done in trespassing.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the fire burning on the altar all night until morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning.
And the priest shall put on his linen garments, and his linen breeches shall be worn on his body, and he shall take up the ashes consumed by the fire from the burnt offering on the altar, and place them beside the altar.
And he shall remove his garments, put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it shall not be extinguished: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, laying the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn the fat of the peace offerings on it.
The fire shall always be burning on the altar; it shall never go out.
And this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD, at the altar.
And he shall take a handful of the fine flour from the grain offering, along with its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering, and burn it on the altar as a sweet aroma, a memorial to the LORD.
And the remainder of it shall be eaten by Aaron and his sons; it shall be eaten with unleavened bread in a holy place; they shall eat it in the courtyard of the tabernacle of meeting.
It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the trespass offering.
All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a perpetual statute in your generations concerning the offerings made by fire to the LORD: everyone who touches them shall be holy.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, which they shall present to the LORD on the day of his anointing; a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a perpetual grain offering, half in the morning and half at night.
In a pan, it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the grain offering shall be offered as a sweet aroma to the LORD.
And the priest, one of his sons who is anointed in his place, shall offer it: it is a perpetual statute to the LORD; it shall be completely burned.
For every grain offering for the priest shall be completely burned; it shall not be eaten.
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.
The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it; it shall be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tabernacle of meeting.
Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy; and when any of its blood is sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.
But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze pot, it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
All the males among the priests shall eat of it; it is most holy.
And no sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burned in the fire.
