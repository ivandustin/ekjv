You shall not make any idols or graven images, nor erect a standing image, nor set up any stone image in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God.
You shall observe my sabbaths and honor my sanctuary; I am the LORD.
If you follow my statutes, keep my commandments, and carry them out;
Then I will provide rain in its season, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
Your threshing will extend to the vintage, and the vintage will reach the sowing time; you will eat your bread to the full and live securely in your land.
I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down without fear; I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your territory.
You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword.
Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will put ten thousand to flight; your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
I will look favorably upon you, make you fruitful, multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
You will eat the old harvest and clear out the old to make way for the new.
I will set my dwelling among you, and my soul will not reject you.
I will walk among you, be your God, and you will be my people.
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be enslaved; I broke the yoke of your bondage and made you walk upright.
But if you do not listen to me and do not observe all these commandments;
And if you despise my statutes or abhor my judgments, so that you do not keep all my commandments but break my covenant:
I will bring upon you terror, consumption, and fever that will consume your eyes and cause sorrow of heart; you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.
I will set my face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you.
If you still do not listen to me, I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
I will break the pride of your power; I will make your skies like iron and your land like bronze.
Your strength will be spent in vain; your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit.
If you walk contrary to me and do not listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
I will send wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your numbers; your roads will become desolate.
If you do not accept correction and continue to walk contrary to me;
Then I will also walk contrary to you and punish you seven times for your sins.
I will bring a sword upon you to avenge the quarrel of my covenant; when you gather within your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
When I break the supply of your bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will deliver your bread by weight; you will eat but not be satisfied.
If you do not listen to me and walk contrary to me;
Then I will walk contrary to you in fury; I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
I will destroy your high places, cut down your images, and cast your corpses upon the corpses of your idols; my soul will abhor you.
I will make your cities desolate and bring your sanctuaries to ruin; I will not accept the aroma of your sweet offerings.
I will bring the land to desolation, and your enemies who dwell there will be astonished.
I will scatter you among the nations and draw a sword after you; your land will be desolate, and your cities will be in ruins.
Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies' land; even then, the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
As long as it lies desolate, it will rest, because it did not rest during your sabbaths when you lived upon it.
To those who are left alive among you, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a shaken leaf will chase them, and they will flee as if fleeing from a sword, and they will fall when no one pursues.
They will stumble over one another as if before a sword, when no one pursues; you will have no power to stand before your enemies.
You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.
Those who are left of you will waste away in their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; they will also pine away because of the iniquities of their fathers.
If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass against me, and that they have walked contrary to me;
And that I also have walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they accept the punishment of their iniquity:
Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and my covenant with Abraham; I will remember the land.
The land will be left by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because they despised my judgments and their souls abhorred my statutes.
Yet, for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, nor will I abhor them to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them, for I am the LORD their God.
But I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God; I am the LORD.
These are the statutes, judgments, and laws that the LORD established between himself and the children of Israel at Mount Sinai through the hand of Moses.
