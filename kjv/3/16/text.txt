And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron's two sons, who offered unauthorized fire before the LORD and died.  
And the LORD instructed Moses to tell Aaron, his brother, that he should not enter the holy place at all times, within the veil before the mercy seat on the ark, lest he die; for the LORD will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.  
Thus, Aaron shall enter the holy place with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.  
He shall wear the holy linen coat, linen breeches on his body, a linen girdle, and a linen mitre; these are holy garments. Therefore, he must wash his body in water before putting them on.  
He shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.  
Aaron shall offer the bull for his own sin offering, making atonement for himself and his household.  
He shall present the two goats before the LORD at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat.  
Aaron shall bring the goat designated by lot for the LORD and offer it as a sin offering.  
But the goat chosen as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make atonement with it and to send it away into the wilderness.  
Aaron shall bring the bull for his sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and his household, killing the bull for his sin offering.  
He shall take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD and a handful of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it within the veil.  
He shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, so that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony, so he does not die.  
He shall take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat toward the east; and in front of the mercy seat, he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times.  
Then he shall kill the goat for the sin offering for the people, bring its blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the bull's blood, sprinkling it on the mercy seat and in front of it.  
He shall make atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel and their transgressions in all their sins; and he shall do the same for the tabernacle of the congregation, which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.  
No one shall be in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household, and all the congregation of Israel.  
He shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it; he shall take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on the horns of the altar all around.  
He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, cleanse it, and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.  
When he has finished reconciling the holy place, the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat.  
Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, all their transgressions, and all their sins, placing them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away by the hand of a suitable man into the wilderness.  
The goat shall bear upon itself all their iniquities to a land not inhabited; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.  
Aaron shall enter the tabernacle of the congregation, remove the linen garments he wore when he went into the holy place, and leave them there.  
He shall wash his body with water in the holy place, put on his garments, come out, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.  
The fat of the sin offering shall be burned on the altar.  
The one who released the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward, he may come into the camp.  
The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried outside the camp; and they shall burn their skins, flesh, and refuse in the fire.  
The one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward, he may come into the camp.  
This shall be a permanent statute for you: on the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all, whether a native or a stranger who dwells among you.  
For on that day, the priest shall make atonement for you to cleanse you, so that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.  
It shall be a sabbath of rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls; this is a permanent statute.  
The priest, whom he shall anoint and consecrate to minister in his father's place, shall make atonement and wear the linen garments, the holy garments.  
He shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, the tabernacle of the congregation, the altar, the priests, and all the people of the congregation.  
This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
