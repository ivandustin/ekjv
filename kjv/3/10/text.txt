And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, put fire in it, added incense, and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them to do.  
Then fire came out from the LORD and consumed them, and they died in the presence of the LORD.  
Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD meant when He said, 'I will be sanctified in those who approach Me, and before all the people, I will be glorified.'" And Aaron remained silent.  
Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come forward and carry your relatives away from the sanctuary and outside the camp."  
So they approached and carried them out of the camp in their tunics, as Moses had instructed.  
Moses said to Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar, his remaining sons, "Do not let your hair hang loose or tear your clothes, lest you die and wrath come upon the whole congregation. But let your relatives, the entire house of Israel, mourn for the fire that the LORD has kindled."  
And you shall not leave the entrance of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you." And they did according to the word of Moses.  
Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,  
"Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations.  
And you shall distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;  
And you shall teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses."  
Moses spoke to Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar, his remaining sons, "Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings made by fire to the LORD, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, for it is most holy.  
You shall eat it in a holy place, for it is your due and the due of your sons from the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire, for so I have been commanded.  
And the wave breast and the heave shoulder you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are your due and the due of your sons, which are given from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.  
The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall be brought with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave them as a wave offering before the LORD; and they shall be yours and your sons' with you, by a perpetual statute, as the LORD has commanded."  
Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron, saying,  
"Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, since it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?  
Look, its blood was not brought inside the holy place; you should have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded."  
And Aaron said to Moses, "Today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and such things have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?"  
When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
