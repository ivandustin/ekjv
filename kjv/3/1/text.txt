And the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them, 'If any man among you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering from the cattle, whether from the herd or from the flock.'
If his offering is a burnt sacrifice from the herd, he must offer a male without blemish; he shall present it willingly at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
He shall place his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
He shall slaughter the bull before the LORD, and the priests, the sons of Aaron, shall bring the blood and sprinkle it around the altar at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation.
He shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall put fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire.
The priests, the sons of Aaron, shall arrange the parts, including the head and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire on the altar.
But he shall wash the innards and the legs with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
If his offering is from the flock, specifically from the sheep or the goats, for a burnt sacrifice, he shall bring a male without blemish.
He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and the priests, the sons of Aaron, shall sprinkle its blood around the altar.
He shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them in order on the wood that is on the fire on the altar.
But he shall wash the innards and the legs with water, and the priest shall bring all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
If the burnt sacrifice he offers to the LORD is from the birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons.
The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar.
He shall remove its crop along with its feathers and cast them beside the altar on the east side, in the place of the ashes.
He shall split it open with its wings, but shall not divide it completely; and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
