And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and tell them: This is the commandment that the LORD has given, saying,
Any man from the house of Israel who kills an ox, lamb, or goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp,
And does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be charged against that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
So that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD.
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat as a sweet aroma to the LORD.
And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to demons, after whom they have gone astray. This shall be a lasting ordinance for them throughout their generations.
And you shall tell them, Any man from the house of Israel, or from the strangers who dwell among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
And does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it to the LORD; that man shall be cut off from among his people.
And any man from the house of Israel, or from the strangers who dwell among you, who eats any kind of blood; I will set my face against that person who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger who dwells among you eat blood.
And any man from the children of Israel, or from the strangers who dwell among you, who hunts and catches any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.
For it is the life of all flesh; its blood is for the life thereof: therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh: for the life of all flesh is its blood: whoever eats it shall be cut off.
And every person who eats that which died of itself, or that which was torn by beasts, whether it is one of your own country or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until evening: then he shall be clean.
But if he does not wash them, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
