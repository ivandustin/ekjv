And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to Aaron and his sons, instructing them to separate themselves from the holy offerings of the children of Israel, and not to profane my holy name in the offerings they present to me: I am the LORD.  
Tell them, Anyone from your lineage throughout your generations who approaches the holy offerings that the children of Israel dedicate to the LORD while in a state of uncleanness shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.  
Any man from Aaron's descendants who is a leper or has a discharge shall not eat of the holy offerings until he is clean. And anyone who touches anything unclean due to a dead body, or a man who has had a seminal emission;  
Or anyone who touches any creeping creature that could make him unclean, or a person from whom he could contract uncleanness, whatever the source of his uncleanness;  
The person who touches any of these shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy offerings unless he washes his body with water.  
When the sun sets, he shall be clean and may then eat of the holy offerings, for they are his food.  
He shall not eat anything that dies of itself or is torn by beasts, to avoid defiling himself with it; I am the LORD.  
They must therefore observe my ordinances, lest they incur guilt and die for profaning them: I, the LORD, sanctify them.  
No outsider shall eat of the holy offerings; a sojourner of the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy offerings.  
However, if the priest buys a person with his money, that person may eat of it, and those born in his household may eat of his food.  
If the priest's daughter marries an outsider, she may not eat of the holy offerings.  
But if the priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, has no children, and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; but no outsider shall eat of it.  
If a man eats of the holy offerings unintentionally, he must add a fifth of its value to it and give it to the priest along with the holy offering.  
They must not profane the holy offerings of the children of Israel, which they present to the LORD;  
Nor allow them to bear the guilt of trespass when they eat their holy offerings, for I, the LORD, sanctify them.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the children of Israel, and tell them, Whoever from the house of Israel or from the strangers in Israel wishes to present an offering for all his vows and freewill offerings to the LORD for a burnt offering;  
You shall offer a male without blemish from the cattle, sheep, or goats at your own discretion.  
But whatever has a blemish, you shall not offer, for it will not be acceptable to you.  
And whoever offers a peace offering to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the cattle or sheep must present it without blemish; there must be no defect in it.  
You shall not offer to the LORD anything blind, broken, maimed, or with a growth, scab, or sore; nor shall you make any fire offering of them on the altar to the LORD.  
You may offer a bull or a lamb with any excess or deficiency in its parts as a freewill offering; but for a vow, it shall not be accepted.  
You shall not offer to the LORD anything bruised, crushed, broken, or cut; nor shall you make any offering of these in your land.  
You shall not accept the bread of your God from a stranger's hand for any of these, for their corruption is in them, and they have blemishes; they shall not be accepted for you.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
When a bull, sheep, or goat is born, it shall remain with its mother for seven days; from the eighth day onward, it shall be accepted as an offering made by fire to the LORD.  
Whether it is a cow or a ewe, you shall not kill both it and its young on the same day.  
When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you may do so at your own discretion.  
On the same day, it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until the next morning: I am the LORD.  
Therefore, you shall keep my commandments and follow them: I am the LORD.  
You shall not profane my holy name; rather, I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD who sanctifies you,  
Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD.
