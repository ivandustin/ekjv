The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he received concerning Israel during the reign of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years prior to the earthquake.  
And he declared, The LORD will roar from Zion and raise His voice from Jerusalem; the dwellings of the shepherds will mourn, and the summit of Carmel will wither.  
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; they have threshed Gilead with iron instruments.  
But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which will consume the palaces of Benhadad.  
I will also break the bar of Damascus and cut off the inhabitants from the plain of Aven, along with those who hold the scepter from the house of Eden; the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir, says the LORD.  
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; they carried away the entire captivity to deliver them to Edom.  
But I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, which will consume its palaces.  
I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod and those who hold the scepter from Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, says the Lord GOD.  
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; they delivered up the entire captivity to Edom and did not remember the brotherly covenant.  
But I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, which will consume its palaces.  
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; he pursued his brother with the sword, showed no pity, and his anger tore perpetually, keeping his wrath forever.  
But I will send a fire upon Teman, which will consume the palaces of Bozrah.  
Thus says the LORD: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead to enlarge their territory.  
But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, which will consume its palaces, with shouts on the day of battle and a tempest on the day of the whirlwind.  
And their king will go into captivity, he and his princes together, says the LORD.
