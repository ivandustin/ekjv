Thus has the Lord GOD shown me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.  
He asked, "Amos, what do you see?" I replied, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come for my people of Israel; I will no longer pass by them."  
The songs of the temple will turn to wailing in that day, declares the Lord GOD: there will be many dead bodies in every place; they will be cast out in silence.  
Listen to this, you who consume the needy, seeking to make the poor of the land fail,  
Saying, "When will the new moon be over, so we can sell grain? When will the Sabbath end, so we can offer wheat, making the ephah small and the shekel large, and falsifying the balances with deceit?"  
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?  
The LORD has sworn by the greatness of Jacob, "Surely I will never forget any of their deeds."  
Will not the land tremble for this, and will everyone who dwells there not mourn? It will rise up entirely like a flood; it will be cast out and drowned, as in the flood of Egypt.  
And it will come to pass in that day, says the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will darken the earth in broad daylight.  
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; I will put sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head; it will be like the mourning for an only son, and the end will be like a bitter day.  
Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.  
They will wander from sea to sea, and from the north to the east; they will run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.  
In that day, the fair virgins and young men will faint from thirst.  
Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, "Your god, O Dan, lives," and, "The way of Beersheba lives," they will fall and never rise again.
