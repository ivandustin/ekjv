I witnessed the LORD standing by the altar, and He proclaimed, "Strike the lintel of the door so that the posts may tremble; and strike them down, all of them; I will slay the last of them with the sword. Those who flee will not escape, and those who try to evade will not be saved."
Even if they dig down to hell, My hand will reach them; if they ascend to heaven, I will bring them down from there.
And if they hide themselves on the summit of Carmel, I will search for them and bring them out; even if they conceal themselves from My sight in the depths of the sea, I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.
If they go into captivity before their enemies, I will command the sword, and it will slay them; I will set My gaze upon them for evil, not for good.
The Lord GOD of hosts is the one who touches the land, and it will melt; all who dwell in it will mourn. It will rise up entirely like a flood and will be drowned, as in the flood of Egypt.
He is the one who builds His chambers in the heavens and has established His assembly on the earth; He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth. The LORD is His name.
"Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to Me, O children of Israel?" says the LORD. "Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?"

For behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet not a single grain will fall to the ground.
All the sinners of My people will die by the sword, those who say, "Evil will not overtake or confront us."
In that day, I will raise up the fallen tabernacle of David, and I will repair its breaches; I will raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old.
So that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations called by My name," says the LORD who does this.
Behold, the days are coming," says the LORD, "when the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes will catch up with the one who sows seed; the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it.
I will restore the captivity of My people Israel; they will rebuild the desolate cities and inhabit them; they will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will also make gardens and eat their fruit.
I will plant them in their land, and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them," says the LORD your God.
