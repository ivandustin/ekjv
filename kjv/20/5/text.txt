My son, listen to my wisdom, and pay attention to my understanding:  
So that you may value discretion, and your lips may preserve knowledge.  
For the words of an unfaithful woman are as sweet as honey, and her speech is smoother than oil:  
But her end is as bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.  
Her feet lead down to death; her steps take hold of the grave.  
Do not ponder the path of life, for her ways are unpredictable, and you cannot know them.  
Listen to me now, O children, and do not stray from the words of my mouth.  
Keep your distance from her, and do not approach the door of her house:  
Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel:  
Lest strangers consume your wealth; and your hard work be in the house of a foreigner;  
And you regret it in the end, when your body and flesh are consumed,  
And say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart has despised correction;  
And have not listened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who guided me!  
I was almost caught in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.  
Drink water from your own cistern, and flowing water from your own well.  
Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and streams of water in the streets.  
Let them be exclusively yours, and not shared with strangers.  
Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.  
Let her be as a loving doe and a graceful deer; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and may you always be captivated by her love.  
And why, my son, would you be captivated by an unfaithful woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?  
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He examines all his paths.  
His own iniquities will trap the wicked, and he will be held fast by the cords of his sins.  
He will die without instruction; and in the folly of his arrogance, he will go astray.
