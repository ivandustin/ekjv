My son, cherish my words and treasure my commandments within you.
Obey my commandments and you will live; regard my law as the most precious thing in your sight.
Bind them to your fingers; inscribe them on the tablet of your heart.
Embrace wisdom as your sister and call understanding your closest relative.
These will protect you from the seductive woman, from the stranger who entices with her words.
From the window of my house, I looked through the lattice,
And I observed among the naive, I discerned among the young men, a youth lacking sense,
As he passed through the street near her corner, heading toward her house,
In the twilight, in the evening, in the dark of night.
And behold, a woman approached him, dressed like a harlot, with a cunning heart.
(She is loud and defiant; her feet do not stay at home.
Now she is outside, now in the streets, lurking at every corner.)
So she seized him, kissed him, and with a bold face said to him,
"I have peace offerings with me; today I fulfilled my vows.
Therefore, I came out to meet you, eagerly seeking your presence, and I have found you.
I have adorned my bed with coverings of tapestry, with intricate designs, with fine linen from Egypt.
I have scented my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us indulge in love until morning; let us delight ourselves with affection.
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
He has taken a bag of money with him and will return on the appointed day.
With her persuasive words, she led him astray; with the flattery of her lips, she compelled him.
He follows her immediately, like an ox going to the slaughter, or like a fool heading for correction.
Until a dart pierces his liver; like a bird rushing into a trap, unaware that it is for its life.
Listen to me now, therefore, O children, and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
Do not let your heart stray toward her ways; do not wander into her paths.
For she has caused many to fall; indeed, many strong men have been slain by her.
Her house is the path to destruction, leading down to the chambers of death.
