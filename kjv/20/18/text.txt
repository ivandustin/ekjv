Through desire, a man separates himself and seeks to intermeddle with all wisdom.  
A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in revealing his own heart.  
When the wicked arrive, contempt follows, accompanied by reproach and disgrace.  
The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom is like a flowing brook.  
It is unwise to favor the wicked and to undermine the righteous in judgment.  
A fool's lips lead to conflict, and his mouth invites punishment.  
A fool's mouth leads to his own destruction, and his lips ensnare his soul.  
The words of a gossip are like wounds, penetrating deep into the innermost parts of the belly.  
He who is lazy in his work is a brother to the one who is a great waste.  
The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and find safety.  
The wealth of the rich man is like a fortified city, and he sees it as a high wall in his own mind.  
Before destruction, a man's heart is proud, but humility comes before honor.  
He who answers a matter before hearing it is foolish and brings shame upon himself.  
The spirit of a man can sustain him in sickness, but who can bear a wounded spirit?  
The heart of the prudent seeks knowledge, and the ear of the wise craves understanding.  
A man's gift opens doors for him and brings him before great individuals.  
The one who is first to present his case seems right, but his neighbor comes and examines him.  
Casting lots puts an end to disputes and separates the mighty.  
An offended brother is harder to win than a strong city, and their conflicts are like the bars of a fortress.  
A man's stomach is filled with the fruit of his words; with the increase of his lips, he is satisfied.  
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will reap its rewards.  
Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing and receives favor from the LORD.  
The poor plead for help, but the rich respond harshly.  
A man who has friends must show himself friendly, and there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
