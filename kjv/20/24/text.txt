For their hearts plot destruction, and their words are filled with mischief.
Through wisdom, a house is built; and by understanding, it is established.
By knowledge, the chambers are filled with all precious and delightful riches.
A wise person is strong; indeed, a person of knowledge increases strength.
For with wise counsel, you will wage your war; in a multitude of counselors, there is safety.
Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the assembly.
He who plans to do evil will be called a troublemaker.
The thought of foolishness is sin; and the scoffer is an abomination to others.
If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.
If you refrain from delivering those drawn to death, and those ready to be slain;
If you say, "Behold, we did not know it," does not He who weighs the heart consider it? And He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not repay every person according to their deeds?
My child, eat honey, for it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to your taste.

Do not lie in wait, O wicked person, against the dwelling of the righteous; do not spoil his resting place.
For a just person may fall seven times and rise again; but the wicked will fall into mischief.

Lest the LORD see it and be displeased, and turn away His wrath from him.
Do not fret because of evil people, nor be envious of the wicked.
For there will be no reward for the evil person; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
My child, fear the LORD and the king; do not associate with those who are given to change.

Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause; do not deceive with your lips.
Do not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his deeds."
I passed by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding;
And behold, it was all overgrown with thorns, and nettles had covered its surface, and its stone wall was broken down.
Then I saw and considered it carefully; I looked upon it and received instruction.
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest:
So shall your poverty come like a traveler, and your need like an armed man.
