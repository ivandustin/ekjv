Listen, children, to the guidance of a father, and pay attention to gain understanding.  
For I provide you with sound teaching; do not abandon my instructions.  
I was my father's cherished son, tender and beloved in my mother's eyes.  
He also taught me, saying, "Let your heart hold onto my words: keep my commandments and live."  
Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding: do not forget it; do not stray from the words I speak.  
Do not forsake her, and she will protect you; love her, and she will keep you safe.  
Wisdom is the most important thing; therefore, seek wisdom: and in all your pursuits, seek understanding.  
Honor her, and she will elevate you; she will bring you respect when you embrace her.  
She will grant you a crown of grace upon your head: a glorious crown she will bestow upon you.  
Listen, my son, and accept my teachings; and your years will be many.  
I have instructed you in the way of wisdom; I have guided you along the right paths.  
When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; and when you run, you will not stumble.  
Hold tightly to instruction; do not let her go: keep her, for she is your life.  
Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not follow the way of evil people.  
Avoid it, do not pass by it, turn away from it, and move on.  
For they do not sleep unless they have done something wrong; their sleep is taken away unless they cause someone to fall.  
For they consume the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.  
But the path of the righteous is like the shining light, which shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.  
The way of the wicked is like darkness: they do not know what they stumble over.  
My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.  
Do not let them depart from your sight; keep them in the center of your heart.  
For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.  
Guard your heart with all diligence; for from it flow the springs of life.  
Remove from you a deceitful mouth, and keep perverse lips far from you.  
Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids gaze directly before you.  
Consider the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.  
Do not turn to the right or to the left; keep your foot from evil.
