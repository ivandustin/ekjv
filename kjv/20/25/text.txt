These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transcribed.  
It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the honor of kings is to investigate it.  
The heavens are high, the earth is deep, and the hearts of kings are unsearchable.  
Remove the impurities from silver, and a refined vessel will emerge.  
Remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness.  
Do not present yourself in the presence of the king, and do not take a place among great men.  
For it is better to be invited to come up here than to be humiliated in the presence of a prince you have seen.  
Do not rush to argue, lest you find yourself unsure of what to do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame.  
Discuss your case with your neighbor directly, and do not reveal a secret to another.  
Lest the one who hears it shames you, and your disgrace does not depart.  
A well-timed word is like apples of gold in settings of silver.  
Like a gold earring and a fine gold ornament, so is a wise reprover to an attentive ear.  
As cold snow in harvest time, so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters.  
Whoever boasts of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.  
A prince is persuaded by long patience, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.  
Have you found honey? Eat only what is sufficient for you, lest you become full and vomit it.  
Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house, lest he grow weary of you and come to hate you.  
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a hammer, a sword, and a sharp arrow.  
Trusting in an unfaithful person in times of trouble is like having a broken tooth or a dislocated foot.  
As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar on soda, so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.  
If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.  
For you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.  
The north wind drives away rain; so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.  
It is better to dwell in the corner of a rooftop than to share a house with a quarrelsome woman.  
As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a distant land.  
A righteous man who falls before the wicked is like a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring.  
It is not good to eat too much honey; so it is not glory for men to seek their own honor.  
He who has no control over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls.
