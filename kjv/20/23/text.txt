When you sit down to eat with a ruler, carefully consider what is before you.
And if you are someone who craves indulgence, put a knife to your throat.
Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.
Do not strive to be rich; refrain from relying on your own understanding.
Will you set your eyes on what is not? For wealth can easily take flight; it soars away like an eagle in the sky.
Do not eat the bread of one with an evil eye, nor crave his fine foods.
For as he thinks in his heart, so is he: "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
The morsel you have eaten will be regurgitated, and you will lose your pleasant words.
Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words.
Do not remove the ancient boundary stones, and do not encroach on the fields of the fatherless.
For their Redeemer is strong; He will defend their cause against you.
Direct your heart toward instruction, and your ears toward knowledge.
Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die.
You shall strike him with the rod and save his soul from destruction.
My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will rejoice, even mine.
Yes, my innermost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
Do not let your heart envy sinners; instead, remain in the fear of the LORD all day long.
For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
Listen, my son, and be wise; direct your heart in the right way.
Do not associate with heavy drinkers or gluttonous eaters of meat.
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe a man in rags.
Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
Buy the truth and do not sell it; also acquire wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, and he who begets a wise child will find joy in him.
Your father and mother will be glad, and she who bore you will rejoice.
My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.
For an immoral woman is a deep pit, and a strange woman is a narrow well.
She lies in wait like a thief, and increases the unfaithful among men.
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has unnecessary wounds? Who has red eyes?
Those who linger long over wine, those who go to taste mixed wine.
Do not look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
In the end, it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.
Your eyes will see strange sights, and your heart will utter perverse things.
Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, or like one who lies on the top of a mast.
You will say, "They struck me, but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When will I wake up? I will seek it again."
