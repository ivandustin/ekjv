Better is a poor person who walks in integrity than one who is perverse in speech and a fool.  
Moreover, it is not good for the soul to lack knowledge; he who rushes with his feet sins.  
The foolishness of a person distorts their path, and their heart frets against the LORD.  
Wealth attracts many friends, but the poor is isolated from their neighbor.  
A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who speaks lies will not escape.  
Many will seek the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to those who give gifts.  
All the relatives of the poor despise him; how much more do his friends distance themselves? He pursues them with words, yet they are absent.  
He who gains wisdom loves his own soul; he who holds onto understanding will find good.  
A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who speaks lies will perish.  
Delight is not fitting for a fool; much less is it appropriate for a servant to rule over princes.  
A man's discretion delays his anger; it is his glory to overlook an offense.  
The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.  
A foolish son brings calamity to his father, and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.  
A house and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is a gift from the LORD.  
Laziness leads to deep sleep, and an idle soul will suffer hunger.  
He who keeps the commandment preserves his own soul; but he who despises his ways will die.  
He who shows compassion to the poor lends to the LORD, and what he has given will be repaid.  
Discipline your son while there is hope, and do not be unwilling to correct him for his crying.  
A man of great anger will face punishment; if you rescue him, you will have to do it again.  
Listen to counsel and accept instruction, so that you may be wise in your later years.  
There are many plans in a person's heart, but the counsel of the LORD will stand.  
A person's desire is their kindness, and a poor person is better than a liar.  
The fear of the LORD leads to life; he who has it will be satisfied and will not encounter evil.  
A lazy person hides their hand in their bosom and will not even bring it to their mouth.  
Strike a scoffer, and the simple will take warning; reprove one who has understanding, and they will gain knowledge.  
He who wastes his father and drives away his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace.  
My son, stop listening to instruction that leads you away from the words of knowledge.  
An ungodly witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked consumes iniquity.  
Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and stripes are for the backs of fools.
