A good name is to be chosen over great riches, and loving favor is better than silver and gold.  
The rich and the poor come together; the LORD is the creator of them all.  
A wise person foresees danger and takes refuge, but the naive continue on and suffer the consequences.  
Through humility and the fear of the LORD come riches, honor, and life.  
Thorns and snares lie in the path of the perverse; whoever guards their soul stays far from them.  
Train a child in the way they should go, and when they are old, they will not depart from it.  
The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender.  
Whoever sows iniquity will reap vanity; the rod of their anger will fail.  
The one with a generous eye will be blessed, for they share their bread with the poor.  
Cast out the scoffer, and strife will cease; contention and reproach will vanish.  
Whoever loves a pure heart and gracious speech will have the king as their friend.  
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, but He overthrows the words of the transgressor.  
The slothful person says, "There is a lion outside; I will be killed in the streets."  
The words of an immoral woman are a deep pit; whoever is detested by the LORD will fall into it.  
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it far from them.  
Whoever oppresses the poor to increase their wealth, and gives to the rich, will surely come to want.  
Listen closely and hear the words of the wise; apply your heart to my knowledge.  
For it is pleasant if you keep them within you; they will be fitting on your lips.  
So that your trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to you today, even to you.  
Have I not written to you excellent things in counsel and knowledge,  
To make you know the certainty of the words of truth, so you may give a true answer to those who send you?  
Do not rob the poor because they are poor, nor oppress the afflicted at the gate;  
For the LORD will plead their cause and will take the life of those who rob them.  
Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, and do not associate with one easily angered;  
Lest you learn their ways and get ensnared in your soul.  
Do not be one of those who strike hands or pledge for debts.  
If you have nothing to pay, why should they take your bed from under you?  
Do not remove the ancient landmark that your ancestors have set.  
Do you see a man diligent in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
