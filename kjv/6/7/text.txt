The children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the accursed thing: Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed item, and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Bethaven, east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, "Go up and view the land." The men went up and surveyed Ai.
They returned to Joshua and said, "Do not let all the people go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; do not weary all the people, for they are few."
So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai.
The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them; they chased them from the gate to Shebarim and struck them down on the descent. The hearts of the people melted and became like water.
Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the LORD until evening, along with the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads.
Joshua said, "Alas, O LORD God, why have you brought this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
O LORD, what can I say when Israel turns their backs before their enemies?
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?"
The LORD said to Joshua, "Get up; why are you lying on your face like this?
Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them. They have taken some of the accursed items, stolen, and concealed them among their own belongings.
Therefore, the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs because they are accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the accursed items from among you.
Get up, sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the LORD God of Israel: There is an accursed item in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you remove the accursed item from among you.'
In the morning, you shall present yourselves by your tribes, and the tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward by families; the family that the LORD selects shall come forward by households, and the household that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.
The one who is caught with the accursed item shall be burned with fire, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and has committed a disgraceful act in Israel."
So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
He brought the family of Judah forward, and the family of the Zarhites was selected. He brought the family of the Zarhites forward man by man, and Zabdi was selected.
He brought his household forward man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was selected.
Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to Him. Tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."
Achan answered Joshua, "Indeed, I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:
When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; indeed, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
They took the items from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the children of Israel, laying them out before the LORD.
Joshua, along with all Israel, took Achan, the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and brought them to the valley of Achor.
Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day." All Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after stoning them.
They raised a large heap of stones over him, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore, that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.
