And it came to pass, when all the kings on this side of the Jordan, in the hills, in the valleys, and along all the coasts of the great sea opposite Lebanon—the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—heard of it;
They gathered together to fight against Joshua and Israel, united in their purpose.
When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
They acted cunningly, pretending to be ambassadors, taking old sacks on their donkeys, and worn-out wine bottles that were torn and mended;
They wore old shoes and patched garments, and all the bread they brought for their provisions was dry and moldy.
They went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country; now, therefore, make a treaty with us."
The men of Israel replied to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; how can we make a treaty with you?"
They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua asked them, "Who are you, and where do you come from?"
They answered him, "From a very distant country your servants have come because of the name of the LORD your God; we have heard of His fame and all that He did in Egypt,
And all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Therefore, our elders and all the inhabitants of our country instructed us, saying, 'Take provisions for the journey and go to meet them. Say to them, "We are your servants; now make a treaty with us."'
This bread we took hot from our homes on the day we set out to meet you; now, behold, it is dry and moldy.
These wine bottles, which we filled, were new; now, behold, they are torn; and our garments and shoes have become worn out from the very long journey.
The men took some of their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD's counsel.
Joshua made peace with them and made a treaty to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
It came to pass that three days after they had made the treaty with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them.
The children of Israel journeyed and arrived at their cities on the third day. Their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
The children of Israel did not attack them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath by the LORD God of Israel. The entire congregation murmured against the leaders.
But all the leaders said to the congregation, "We have sworn an oath by the LORD God of Israel; we cannot touch them now.
This is what we will do to them: we will let them live, so that wrath does not come upon us because of the oath we swore to them."
The leaders said to them, "Let them live; but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire congregation," as the leaders had promised them.
Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us by saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you actually dwell among us?
Now, therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being bondmen, woodcutters, and water carriers for the house of my God."
They answered Joshua, "Because it was clearly told to your servants how the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, we were terrified for our lives because of you, and we did this thing.
And now, behold, we are in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to you."
So he did this to them and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them.
Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place he would choose.
