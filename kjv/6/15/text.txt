This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; the southernmost boundary extended to the border of Edom, reaching the wilderness of Zin.
Their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
It extended southward to Maalehacrabbim, then continued to Zin, ascending on the southern side to Kadeshbarnea, passing along to Hezron, and moving up to Adar, circling around to Karkaa.
From there, it moved toward Azmon and reached the river of Egypt; the endpoints of that border were at the sea: this shall be your southern boundary.
The eastern border was the Salt Sea, extending to the mouth of the Jordan River. The northern boundary began at the bay of the sea at the northernmost point of the Jordan.
The border ascended to Bethhogla, passing north of Betharabah, and continued to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.
The border ascended toward Debir from the valley of Achor, moving northward, facing Gilgal, which is before the ascent to Adummim, located on the southern side of the river; the border then moved toward the waters of Enshemesh, with its endpoints at Enrogel.
The border ascended by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the southern side of the Jebusite, which is Jerusalem; it then rose to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom to the west, at the northern end of the valley of the giants.
The border was drawn from the top of the hill to the spring of the water of Nephtoah, extending to the cities of Mount Ephron; the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim.
The border circled from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, passing along the side of Mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the northern side, then descending to Bethshemesh and continuing to Timnah.
The border extended to the side of Ekron northward; it was drawn to Shicron, passing along to Mount Baalah, and reaching Jabneel; the endpoints of the border were at the sea.
The western border was the Great Sea and its coastline. This is the boundary of the children of Judah, according to their families.
To Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he gave a portion among the children of Judah, as commanded by the LORD to Joshua, specifically the city of Arba, the father of Anak, which is Hebron.
Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
He then went up to the inhabitants of Debir, which was formerly known as Kirjathsepher.
Caleb declared, "Whoever attacks Kirjathsepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as a wife."
Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, captured it, and Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.
When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
She replied, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me a south land, grant me also springs of water." He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
