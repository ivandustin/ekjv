There was also a lot designated for the tribe of Manasseh, as he was the firstborn of Joseph; specifically, for Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, who was the father of Gilead. Because he was a warrior, he received Gilead and Bashan.
Additionally, there was a lot for the remaining descendants of Manasseh by their families, including the children of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, organized by their families.
However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to grant us an inheritance among our relatives." Therefore, in accordance with the LORD's command, he gave them an inheritance among the relatives of their father.
Manasseh received ten portions, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were located on the other side of the Jordan.
The daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance alongside his sons, while the remaining sons of Manasseh received the land of Gilead.
The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Michmethah, which lies before Shechem; the border went to the right, toward the inhabitants of Entappuah.
Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the descendants of Ephraim.
The border descended to the river Kanah, south of the river; these cities of Ephraim were among the cities of Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh was also on the north side of the river, with its boundaries reaching the sea.
To the south was Ephraim's territory, and to the north was Manasseh's, with the sea as their border. They met in Asher to the north and in Issachar to the east.
In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Bethshean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, encompassing three regions.
Yet the descendants of Manasseh were unable to drive out the inhabitants of those cities; the Canaanites continued to dwell in that land.
However, when the children of Israel grew strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not completely drive them out.
The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given us only one lot and one portion to inherit, when I am a numerous people, since the LORD has blessed me so far?"
Joshua replied, "If you are a numerous people, then go up to the forested area and clear land for yourselves there in the territory of the Perizzites and giants, if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you."
The children of Joseph responded, "The hill country is not sufficient for us, and all the Canaanites who dwell in the valley have iron chariots, both those in Bethshean and its towns, and those in the valley of Jezreel."
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, "You are a great people and have great power; you shall not have just one lot.
The mountain shall be yours, for it is a forest, and you shall clear it. Its outlying areas shall be yours, for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and are strong."
