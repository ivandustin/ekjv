Then the heads of the Levite families approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders of the tribes of the children of Israel.  
They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, "The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in, along with their surrounding pasturelands for our livestock."  
The children of Israel, at the command of the LORD, allocated these cities and their pasturelands to the Levites from their inheritance.  
The lot was drawn for the families of the Kohathites, and the children of Aaron the priest, who were Levites, received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, a total of thirteen cities.  
The remaining children of Kohath received by lot from the families of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, a total of ten cities.  
The children of Gershon received by lot from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, a total of thirteen cities.  
The children of Merari received by their families from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun, a total of twelve cities.  
The children of Israel allocated these cities and their pasturelands to the Levites by lot, as the LORD commanded through Moses.  
They designated cities from the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon, which are mentioned here by name.  
The children of Aaron, from the families of the Kohathites, who were descendants of Levi, received the first lot.  
They were given the city of Arba, the father of Anak, which is Hebron, located in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding pasturelands.  
However, the fields of the city and its villages were given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.  
Thus, the children of Aaron the priest received Hebron with its pasturelands, designated as a city of refuge for the slayer, along with Libnah and its pasturelands,  
Jattir and its pasturelands, and Eshtemoa and its pasturelands,  
Holon and its pasturelands, and Debir and its pasturelands,  
Ain and its pasturelands, Juttah and its pasturelands, and Bethshemesh and its pasturelands; a total of nine cities from those two tribes.  
From the tribe of Benjamin, they received Gibeon and its pasturelands, Geba and its pasturelands,  
Anathoth and its pasturelands, and Almon and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
In total, the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, amounted to thirteen cities with their pasturelands.  
The families of the remaining children of Kohath, the Levites, received their cities by lot from the tribe of Ephraim.  
They were given Shechem and its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, designated as a city of refuge for the slayer, along with Gezer and its pasturelands,  
Kibzaim and its pasturelands, and Bethhoron and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the tribe of Dan, they received Eltekeh and its pasturelands, Gibbethon and its pasturelands,  
Aijalon and its pasturelands, and Gathrimmon and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Tanach and its pasturelands, and Gathrimmon and its pasturelands; a total of two cities.  
In total, there were ten cities with their pasturelands for the families of the remaining children of Kohath.  
To the children of Gershon, from the families of the Levites, they allocated Golan in Bashan and its pasturelands, designated as a city of refuge for the slayer, along with Beeshterah and its pasturelands; a total of two cities.  
From the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishon and its pasturelands, Dabareh and its pasturelands,  
Jarmuth and its pasturelands, and Engannim and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the tribe of Asher, they received Mishal and its pasturelands, Abdon and its pasturelands,  
Helkath and its pasturelands, and Rehob and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the tribe of Naphtali, they received Kedesh in Galilee and its pasturelands, designated as a city of refuge for the slayer, along with Hammothdor and its pasturelands, and Kartan and its pasturelands; a total of three cities.  
In total, the cities of the Gershonites according to their families amounted to thirteen cities with their pasturelands.  
To the families of the children of Merari, the remaining Levites, they allocated from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam and its pasturelands, and Kartah and its pasturelands,  
Dimnah and its pasturelands, and Nahalal and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the tribe of Reuben, they received Bezer and its pasturelands, and Jahazah and its pasturelands,  
Kedemoth and its pasturelands, and Mephaath and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
From the tribe of Gad, they received Ramoth in Gilead and its pasturelands, designated as a city of refuge for the slayer, along with Mahanaim and its pasturelands,  
Heshbon and its pasturelands, and Jazer and its pasturelands; a total of four cities.  
Thus, all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which remained of the families of the Levites, amounted to twelve cities by their lot.  
In total, all the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.  
Each of these cities had its surrounding pasturelands; thus, all these cities were accounted for.  
The LORD gave Israel all the land He swore to give to their ancestors; they took possession of it and settled there.  
The LORD provided them rest on every side, as He had sworn to their ancestors; not a single enemy stood against them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hands.  
Nothing failed of any good thing that the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
