And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
"Select twelve men from the people, one from each tribe,"
and command them, saying, "Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the spot where the priests' feet stood firm. Carry them over with you and place them in the lodging area where you will stay tonight."
Then Joshua called the twelve men he had appointed from the children of Israel, one from each tribe.
And Joshua said to them, "Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take a stone on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,
so that this may serve as a sign among you. When your children ask their fathers in the future, 'What do these stones mean?'
you shall tell them, 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters were cut off. These stones shall be a memorial for the children of Israel forever.'"
And the children of Israel did as Joshua commanded; they took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, as the LORD had instructed Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the spot where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood, and they remain there to this day.
For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people was completed, just as Moses had instructed Joshua. The people hurried and crossed over.
And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of the LORD also crossed over, along with the priests, in the presence of the people.
The children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had instructed them.
About forty thousand prepared for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho.
On that day, the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life.
And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
"Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan."
So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out of the Jordan."
And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet touched dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as they had before.
The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal, on the eastern border of Jericho.
And those twelve stones, which they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.
He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your children ask their fathers in the future, 'What do these stones mean?'
you shall inform your children, saying, 'Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry ground.
For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,
so that all the people of the earth may know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty, and that you may fear the LORD your God forever."
