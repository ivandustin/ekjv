And Joshua rose early in the morning; they departed from Shittim and arrived at the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and they camped there before crossing over.  
After three days, the officers went through the camp;  
They instructed the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, the Levites, carrying it, then you shall move from your place and follow it."  
However, there should be a distance of about two thousand cubits between you and it: do not come near it, so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not traveled this way before.  
And Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will perform wonders among you."  
Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant and lead the people across." They took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.  
The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that, just as I was with Moses, I will be with you."  
You shall command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant, saying, "When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan."  
And Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God."  
Joshua declared, "By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites."  
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.  
Now, select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.  
It shall come to pass that as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off from the waters flowing down from above, and they will stand in a heap.  
When the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went before the people;  
As those who bore the ark approached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the harvest),  
The waters flowing down from above stood still and rose up in a heap very far from the city of Adam, which is near Zaretan; and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off, and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.  
The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all the Israelites crossed over on dry ground until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
