The territory of the children of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, reaching to the waters of Jericho on the eastern side, and included the wilderness that ascends from Jericho to Mount Bethel.
It continued from Bethel to Luz, and then along the borders of Archi to Ataroth.
The boundary then descended westward to the region of Japhleti, reaching the lower Bethhoron and Gezer; the exits of this territory were by the sea.
Thus, the children of Joseph, namely Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
The boundary of the children of Ephraim, according to their families, was as follows: on the eastern side, it began at Atarothaddar and extended to the upper Bethhoron.
The border then extended toward the sea to Michmethah on the northern side, and it turned eastward to Taanathshiloh, passing by it on the east to Janohah.
From Janohah, it descended to Ataroth and Naarath, reaching Jericho and exiting at the Jordan River.
The boundary extended from Tappuah westward to the Kanah River, with the exits of this territory being by the sea. This constitutes the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim according to their families.
The designated cities for the children of Ephraim were included within the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, encompassing all the cities and their villages.
However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; thus, the Canaanites continue to dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, serving under tribute.
