And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, "Do not fear or be disheartened. Take all the warriors with you and go up to Ai. Look, I have delivered the king of Ai, along with his people, his city, and his land, into your hands. 
You shall treat Ai and its king as you did Jericho and its king; however, you may take the spoils and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city." 
So Joshua rose up, along with all the warriors, to confront Ai. He selected thirty thousand valiant men and sent them out at night. 
He instructed them, saying, "You will lie in wait against the city, behind it. Do not go too far from the city, and be ready. 
I and all the people with me will approach the city. When they come out to fight us, as they did before, we will flee before them. 
(They will pursue us) until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will think, 'They are fleeing before us, just like before.' Therefore, we will flee before them. 
Then you will rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will hand it over to you. 
When you have captured the city, you shall set it on fire, as the LORD has commanded. See, I have instructed you." 
Joshua sent them out, and they went to lie in ambush, staying between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai, while Joshua spent the night among the people. 
Early the next morning, Joshua counted the people and went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai. 
All the warriors with him approached the city, drawing near and camping on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the city. 
He took about five thousand men and positioned them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
After arranging the troops, with the main force to the north of the city and the ambushers to the west, Joshua went into the valley that night. 
When the king of Ai saw this, he hurriedly rose early, and the men of the city went out to battle against Israel at the appointed time, unaware that there were ambushers behind the city. 
Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated and fled into the wilderness. 
All the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they chased after Joshua, drawing away from the city. 
Not a single man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not pursue Israel, leaving the city open as they followed after them. 
The LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." Joshua stretched out his spear toward the city. 
The ambushers quickly rose from their positions and ran as soon as he stretched out his hand; they entered the city, took it, and set it on fire. 
When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke of the city rising to heaven, and they had no strength to flee in any direction; those who had fled to the wilderness turned back against their pursuers. 
When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke was rising, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 
The others came out of the city to confront them, so they were caught in the middle of Israel, some on one side and some on the other, and they struck them down, leaving no survivors. 
They captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. 
When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when they had all fallen by the sword, the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword. 
That day, twelve thousand men and women fell, all the men of Ai. 
Joshua did not withdraw his hand, with which he had stretched out the spear, until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
Only the livestock and the spoils of that city did Israel take for themselves, as the LORD had commanded Joshua. 
Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day. 
He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; when the sun set, Joshua commanded that they take his body down from the tree and throw it at the entrance of the city gate, raising a large heap of stones over it, which remains to this day. 
Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel on Mount Ebal, 
as Moses, the servant of the LORD, had commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of whole stones, over which no iron tool had been used. They offered burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings. 
He wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of the Israelites. 
All Israel, along with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well as the foreigners and those born among them; half of them faced Mount Gerizim and half faced Mount Ebal, as Moses had commanded, to bless the people of Israel. 
Afterward, he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read before the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, children, and foreigners who lived among them.
