Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,  
and said to them, "You have faithfully followed all that Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you, and you have obeyed my instructions in everything I commanded you.  
You have not abandoned your fellow Israelites these many days up to this day, but have upheld the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.  
Now the LORD your God has granted rest to your fellow Israelites, as He promised them; therefore, return to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, assigned to you on the other side of the Jordan.  
But be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul."  
So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.  
To the half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given land in Bashan, but to the other half, Joshua gave land among their brothers on this side of the Jordan, westward. When Joshua sent them away to their tents, he also blessed them,  
and he said to them, "Return with great wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with a great quantity of clothing; divide the spoils of your enemies with your brothers."  
The children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the region of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had received according to the word of the LORD through Moses.  
When they reached the borders of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar by the Jordan, a large altar visible from afar.  
The children of Israel heard it said, "Behold, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan, at the borders of the Jordan, at the crossing point for the children of Israel."  
When the children of Israel heard this, the entire congregation gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.  
The children of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead,  
along with ten leaders, one from each chief house throughout all the tribes of Israel; each was the head of a family among the thousands of Israel.  
They went to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and spoke to them, saying,  
"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD: What is this trespass you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for yourselves, thereby rebelling against the LORD?  
Is the iniquity of Peor too small for us, from which we have not been cleansed to this day, even though a plague came upon the congregation of the LORD?  
But now you must turn away this day from following the LORD? If you rebel today against the LORD, tomorrow His anger will be against the whole congregation of Israel.  
Nevertheless, if the land you possess is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD's possession, where the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against the LORD, nor against us, by building an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.  
Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, commit a trespass regarding the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man did not perish alone in his iniquity."  
Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the thousands of Israel,  
"The LORD God of gods knows, and Israel will know; if it is in rebellion or in transgression against the LORD, do not save us this day.  
If we have built an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings, or to offer peace offerings on it, let the LORD Himself require it.  
And if we have not done it out of fear of this thing, saying, 'In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?'  
For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no part in the LORD, so your children might make our children cease from fearing the LORD.  
Therefore, we said, 'Let us now prepare to build an altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices,  
but as a witness between us and you and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings; so that your children may not say to our children in time to come, "You have no part in the LORD."  
Therefore, we said, when they say this to us or to our generations in the future, we may say, 'Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.'  
God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before His tabernacle."  
When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.  
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD; now you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the LORD."  
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.  
The matter pleased the children of Israel, and they blessed God and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.  
The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar Ed, for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.
