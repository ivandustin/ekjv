But Jonah was exceedingly displeased, and he became very angry.
He prayed to the LORD, saying, "I pray, O LORD, was this not what I said when I was still in my own country? That is why I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You are a gracious God, merciful, slow to anger, abundant in kindness, and willing to relent from sending calamity."
"Now, O LORD, I beseech You, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."
The LORD replied, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
So Jonah left the city and sat down on the east side. He made a shelter for himself and sat in its shade, waiting to see what would happen to the city.
The LORD God provided a plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head, to ease his discomfort. Jonah was very happy about the plant.
But God also provided a worm the next morning, which chewed the plant so that it withered.
When the sun rose, God sent a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wished to die and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."
But God asked Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?" Jonah replied, "It is right for me to be angry, even to the point of death."
The LORD said, "You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend to it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and also many animals?"
