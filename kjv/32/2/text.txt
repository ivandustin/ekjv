Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,  
And said, I cried out because of my affliction to the LORD, and He heard me; from the depths of despair I cried, and You heard my voice.  
For You had thrown me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the waters surrounded me: all Your waves and billows passed over me.  
Then I said, I am cast out of Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.  
The waters surrounded me, even to my soul: the depths closed in around me, and the seaweed wrapped around my head.  
I went down to the roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars was about me forever: yet You brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.  
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came to You, into Your holy temple.  
Those who regard worthless idols forsake their own mercy.  
But I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD.  
And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah onto dry land.
