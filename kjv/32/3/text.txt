And the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,  
"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I give you."  
So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, in accordance with the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, taking three days to journey through.  
And Jonah began to enter the city, walking for a day, and he cried out, saying, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh will be overthrown."  
The people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and donned sackcloth, from the greatest to the least.  
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  
He then issued a proclamation throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, stating, "Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed or drink water.  
But let both man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry out earnestly to God; let everyone turn from their evil ways and from the violence in their hands.  
Who knows? God may turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we do not perish."  
And God saw their actions, that they turned from their evil ways; and God relented from the disaster He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it.
