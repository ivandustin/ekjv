After these events, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, elevated him, and placed his position above all the princes who were with him.  
All the king's servants at the king's gate bowed and honored Haman, as the king had commanded regarding him. However, Mordecai did not bow or show him respect.  
The king's servants at the gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you violate the king's command?"  
When they spoke to him daily and he did not listen, they informed Haman to see if Mordecai's actions would hold, as he had told them he was a Jew.  
When Haman noticed that Mordecai did not bow or show him respect, he became filled with rage.  
He considered it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone; instead, he was informed about Mordecai's people, leading Haman to seek the destruction of all Jews throughout the entire kingdom of Ahasuerus, including Mordecai's people.  
In the first month, which is Nisan, during the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, or lots, before Haman day by day and month by month, until the twelfth month, which is Adar.  
Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other nations, and they do not follow the king's laws. Therefore, it is not in the king's best interest to allow them to remain."  
"If it pleases the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed. I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to those in charge of this matter, to bring it into the king's treasury."  
The king took his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.  
The king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you, and the people as well; do with them as you see fit."  
On the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes were summoned, and they wrote according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, governors over each province, and rulers of every people in their respective provinces, in their own languages; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's ring.  
The letters were dispatched by messengers to all the king's provinces, ordering the destruction, killing, and annihilation of all Jews, young and old, including little children and women, in a single day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder.  
A copy of the decree was issued as a command in every province, making it known to all people, so they would be prepared for that day.  
The messengers hurried out, compelled by the king's command, and the decree was issued in the palace of Shushan. The king and Haman then sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was in turmoil.
