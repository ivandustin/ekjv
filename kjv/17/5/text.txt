Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther donned her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal palace, facing the gate of the house.
And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight: and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
Then the king said to her, "What is it, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be granted to you, even to half of the kingdom."
And Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Then the king said, "Hasten Haman, so that he may do as Esther has said." So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
And the king said to Esther at the wine banquet, "What is your petition? It shall be granted to you: and what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be fulfilled."
Then Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is this:
If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."
Then Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not rise or move for him, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent for his friends and Zeresh his wife.
And Haman told them of the splendor of his riches, the multitude of his children, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had been elevated above the princes and servants of the king.
Haman added, "Indeed, Esther the queen did not allow anyone to come in with the king to the banquet she had prepared except me; and tomorrow I am also invited to her with the king."
Yet all this means nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go in merrily with the king to the banquet." And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made.
