On the third day, Esther donned her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's residence. The king was seated on his royal throne in the palace, facing the entrance.
When the king noticed Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his eyes. He extended the golden scepter that was in his hand toward her. Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
The king then asked her, "What is it you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It will be granted to you, even up to half of my kingdom."
Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let him and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for him."
The king instructed, "Hasten Haman so that he may do as Esther has requested." So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had arranged.
During the banquet, the king asked Esther, "What is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it will be fulfilled."
Esther responded, "My petition and request are this: If I have found favor in the king's sight, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said."
That day, Haman left joyfully and in high spirits. However, when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate, who did not rise or show fear before him, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
Despite this, Haman restrained himself. When he returned home, he sent for his friends and his wife, Zeresh.
Haman shared with them the splendor of his wealth, the number of his children, and all the honors the king had bestowed upon him, including his elevation above the king's officials and servants.
Haman added, "Moreover, Queen Esther invited no one but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared, and tomorrow I am also invited to dine with her and the king."
Yet, all of this means nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends advised him, "Let a gallows be built, fifty cubits high, and tomorrow, ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go joyfully with the king to the banquet." This suggestion pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed.
