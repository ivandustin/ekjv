In the days of Ahasuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, it came to pass:  
During this time, when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom in Shushan the palace,  
In the third year of his reign, he hosted a feast for all his princes and servants; the power of Persia and Media, along with the nobles and princes of the provinces, were present before him.  
He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty for many days, a total of one hundred and eighty days.  
When these days were over, the king held a feast for all the people present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, for seven days in the court of the king's garden.  
There were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars; the beds were made of gold and silver, set upon a pavement of red, blue, white, and black marble.  
They served drinks in vessels of gold, each vessel unique, and royal wine in abundance, reflecting the king's grandeur.  
The drinking was in accordance with the law; no one was compelled, for the king had instructed all the officers of his house to act according to each person's preference.  
Queen Vashti also hosted a feast for the women in the royal house belonging to King Ahasuerus.  
On the seventh day, when the king's heart was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,  
To bring Queen Vashti before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to behold.  
However, Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command through his chamberlains; therefore, the king was very angry, and his fury burned within him.  
Then the king asked the wise men who understood the times, for it was the king's custom to consult those knowledgeable in law and judgment.  
Next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king's presence and sat first in the kingdom.  
"What shall we do to Queen Vashti according to the law, since she has not obeyed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the chamberlains?"  
Memucan answered before the king and the princes, "Vashti the queen has not wronged the king alone, but also all the princes and all the people in every province of King Ahasuerus.  
For this act of the queen will become known to all women, leading them to despise their husbands in their eyes when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.'  
Likewise, the ladies of Persia and Media will say this day to all the king's princes, who have heard of the queen's deed. This will lead to excessive contempt and anger.  
If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be issued, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and Medes, which cannot be altered, that Vashti shall no longer come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.  
When the king's decree is published throughout his vast empire, all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.  
The proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king acted according to the word of Memucan:  
He sent letters to all the king's provinces, to each province in its own script, and to every people in their own language, instructing that every man should be the ruler in his own house, and that this should be proclaimed in the language of each people.
