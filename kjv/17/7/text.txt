So the king and Haman attended a banquet with Queen Esther.
On the second day of the wine banquet, the king asked Esther again, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be fulfilled, even up to half of my kingdom."
Esther the queen replied, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases you, grant me my life at my petition, and my people at my request.
For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, killed, and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as slaves, I would have remained silent, for the adversary could not compensate for the king's loss."
The king Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, that dares to presume in his heart to do such a thing?"
Esther replied, "The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman." Haman then became fearful before the king and the queen.
In his anger, the king rose from the wine banquet and went into the palace garden, while Haman stood up to plead for his life with Queen Esther, realizing that the king had determined evil against him.
When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, he found Haman fallen on the couch where Esther was. The king exclaimed, "Will he also assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?" As soon as the words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, "Look, the gallows fifty cubits high that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke well of the king, stands at Haman's house." The king commanded, "Hang him on it."
So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king's anger was pacified.
