After these events, when King Ahasuerus's anger subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and the decree made against her.  
Then the king's attendants suggested, "Let fair young virgins be sought for the king."  
And let the king appoint officials in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, under the care of Hege, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let them be provided with their purification items.  
And let the maiden who pleases the king be made queen instead of Vashti. This proposal pleased the king, and he agreed to it.  
Now in Shushan the palace, there was a certain Jew named Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite.  
He had been taken captive from Jerusalem with those who were exiled with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had carried away.  
Mordecai raised Hadassah, also known as Esther, his uncle's daughter, for she had no father or mother. The maiden was lovely and beautiful; when her parents died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter.  
When the king's command and decree were proclaimed, and many maidens were gathered to Shushan the palace under the care of Hegai, Esther was also brought to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.  
The maiden pleased him, and she found favor in his sight; he quickly provided her with her purification items, along with her personal belongings, and seven maidens suitable to serve her from the king's house. He placed her and her maids in the best quarters of the house of the women.  
Esther had not revealed her heritage or her people, for Mordecai had instructed her not to disclose it.  
Mordecai walked daily in front of the court of the women's house to learn how Esther was doing and what would become of her.  
When it was time for each maiden to go in to King Ahasuerus, after she had completed twelve months of preparation (for this was the time required for their purification, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and other preparations for the women),  
Each maiden approached the king; whatever she desired was given to her to take from the house of the women to the king's house.  
In the evening, she would go in, and in the morning, she would return to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless he delighted in her and called for her by name.  
When it was Esther's turn, the daughter of Abihail, Mordecai's uncle who had adopted her, she requested nothing except what Hegai, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women, advised. Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.  
So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.  
The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.  
Then the king held a great feast for all his officials and servants, even Esther's feast; he proclaimed a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of the king.  
When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.  
Esther had not yet revealed her family background or her people, as Mordecai had instructed her, for she continued to follow Mordecai's command just as she had when she was brought up by him.  
In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the door, became angry and sought to assassinate King Ahasuerus.  
The matter became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther, the queen; and Esther reported it to the king in Mordecai's name.  
When the matter was investigated and found to be true, both men were hanged on a gallows, and it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.
