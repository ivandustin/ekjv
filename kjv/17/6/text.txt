On that night, the king could not sleep, so he commanded that the book of records of the chronicles be brought; they were read before him.  
It was discovered that Mordecai had informed about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the gatekeepers, who had conspired to harm King Ahasuerus.  
The king asked, "What honor and dignity have been bestowed upon Mordecai for this?" The king's servants who attended him replied, "Nothing has been done for him."  
The king then inquired, "Who is in the court?" At that moment, Haman had entered the outer court of the king's house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared.  
The king's servants informed him, "Look, Haman is standing in the court." The king said, "Let him come in."  
So Haman entered, and the king asked him, "What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman thought to himself, "Whom would the king want to honor more than me?"  
Haman replied to the king, "For the man whom the king wishes to honor, let royal apparel be brought that the king wears, and the horse that the king rides, along with the royal crown placed upon his head.  
Let this apparel and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes, so they may dress the man whom the king wishes to honor and lead him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.'"  
Then the king said to Haman, "Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate; do not neglect any of the details you have mentioned."  
Haman took the apparel and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor."  
Afterward, Mordecai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried home, mourning and with his head covered.  
Haman shared with Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His wise men and Zeresh advised him, "If Mordecai is of Jewish descent, before whom you have begun to fall, you will not prevail against him; you will surely fall before him."  
While they were still speaking with him, the king's chamberlains arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
