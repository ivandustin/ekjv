Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of that month, when the king's command and decree were about to be executed, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, it turned out differently, as the Jews gained authority over those who hated them.
The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to defend themselves against those who sought to harm them, and no one could stand against them, for the fear of them fell upon all people.
All the rulers of the provinces, along with the lieutenants, deputies, and officers of the king, supported the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had come upon them.
Mordecai was prominent in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces, for this man Mordecai became greater and greater.
Thus, the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.
In Shushan the palace, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,
the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not lay their hands on the spoils.
On that day, the number of those slain in Shushan the palace was reported to the king.
The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now, what is your petition? It shall be granted to you; or what is your further request? It shall be done."
Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let the Jews in Shushan be allowed to act tomorrow as they did today, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
The king commanded that it be done, and the decree was issued in Shushan; they hanged Haman's ten sons.
The Jews in Shushan gathered again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Shushan, but they did not lay their hands on the spoils.
The other Jews in the king's provinces gathered together, stood for their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their foes, but they did not lay their hands on the spoils.
This occurred on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar; and on the fourteenth day, they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
However, the Jews in Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day and the fourteenth day; and on the fifteenth day, they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
Therefore, the Jews in the villages, who lived in unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a good day, and of sending portions to one another.
Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
to establish this among them, that they should observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
as the days when the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions to one another, and gifts to the poor.
The Jews agreed to continue as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;
because Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to annihilate them;
but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Therefore, they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Thus, for all the words of this letter, and for what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had come to them,
the Jews ordained and took upon themselves, their descendants, and all who joined them, that these two days should not fail, and that they would keep these days according to their writing and their appointed time every year;
and that these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor should the memorial of them perish from their descendants.
Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
He sent the letters to all the Jews in the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants, regarding the matters of fasting and their cry.
The decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was recorded in the book.
