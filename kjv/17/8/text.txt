On that day, King Ahasuerus granted the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Esther the queen. Mordecai then approached the king, as Esther had revealed his relationship to her.
The king removed his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther appointed Mordecai to oversee the house of Haman.
Esther spoke again before the king, falling at his feet and pleading with tears to remove the evil of Haman the Agagite and the plot he had devised against the Jews.
The king extended the golden scepter toward Esther, prompting her to rise and stand before him.
She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the matter seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces.
For how can I bear to see the evil that will come upon my people? Or how can I endure to witness the destruction of my kin?"
Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he attempted to harm the Jews.
Write also for the Jews as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing that is in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring cannot be reversed."
The king's scribes were summoned at that time in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the lieutenants, the deputies, and the rulers of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, a hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing and language.
He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by messengers on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries.
In these letters, the king granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and defend their lives, to destroy, kill, and annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, including women and children, and to take their possessions as plunder.
This was to take place on a single day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, specifically on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
A copy of the decree was issued as a command in every province and made known to all people, instructing the Jews to be prepared on that day to take vengeance on their enemies.
The messengers riding on mules and camels hurried out, pressed on by the king's command, and the decree was proclaimed in the citadel of Shushan.
Mordecai left the king's presence in royal garments of blue and white, wearing a great crown of gold and a robe of fine linen and purple; the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
The Jews experienced light, joy, gladness, and honor.
In every province and city, wherever the king's command and decree reached, the Jews celebrated with joy and gladness, feasting and having a good day. Many people of the land became Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
