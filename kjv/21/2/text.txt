I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with joy; therefore, indulge in pleasure." But behold, this too is meaningless.  
I spoke of laughter, "It is madness," and of joy, "What does it accomplish?"  
I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, while also seeking wisdom; and to grasp folly, so that I might understand what is good for the children of men to do under heaven during the days of their lives.  
I undertook great projects; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.  
I made gardens and parks, and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.  
I created reservoirs of water to irrigate the trees that produce fruit.  
I acquired servants and maidens, and had servants born in my household; I also amassed great possessions of livestock, both large and small, more than anyone in Jerusalem before me.  
I gathered silver and gold, along with the treasures of kings and provinces; I acquired male and female singers, and the pleasures of men, including musical instruments of all kinds.  
So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom remained with me.  
And whatever my eyes desired, I did not withhold from them; I did not deny my heart any joy, for my heart found joy in all my labor, and this was my reward for all my toil.  
Then I looked at all the works my hands had done and the labor I had expended to achieve them; and behold, all was meaningless and a chasing after the wind, and there was no profit under the sun.  
I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly; for what can a man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.  
Then I realized that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.  
The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and I also perceived that the same fate befalls them both.  
Then I said to myself, "As it happens to the fool, so it happens to me; and why then have I been more wise?" I concluded that this too is meaningless.  
For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever; since in the days to come, all will be forgotten. And how does the wise man die? Just like the fool.  
Therefore, I hated life, because the work done under the sun was burdensome to me; for all is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.  
Indeed, I hated all my labor that I had performed under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.  
And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I showed my wisdom under the sun. This too is meaningless.  
So I decided to give my heart to despair over all the labor I had undertaken under the sun.  
For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, knowledge, and equity; yet to a man who has not worked for it, he will leave it as his portion. This too is meaningless and a great evil.  
For what does a man gain from all his labor and the anxiety of his heart, which he toils at under the sun?  
For all his days are filled with sorrow, and his work is a burden; even at night, his heart finds no rest. This too is meaningless.  
There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in his labor. This too, I saw, is from the hand of God.  
For who can eat or find enjoyment more than I?  
For God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner, He gives the task of gathering and heaping up, only to give to the one who is good before God. This too is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.
