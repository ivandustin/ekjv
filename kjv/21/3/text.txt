To everything, there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:  
A time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to harvest what is planted;  
A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build up;  
A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;  
A time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;  
A time to gain and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to discard;  
A time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak;  
A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.  
What benefit does one have from their labor?  
I have observed the toil that God has given to humanity to engage in.  
He has made everything beautiful in its time; He has also placed eternity in their hearts, so that no one can fathom the work of God from beginning to end.  
I know that there is no good in them, except for a person to find joy and do good in their life.  
And also that everyone should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor; this is a gift from God.  
I know that whatever God does will last forever; nothing can be added to it, nor taken from it; and God does this so that people may fear Him.  
What has been will be; and what is to come has already been; and God requires what is past.  
Furthermore, I observed under the sun the place of judgment, where wickedness was present; and the place of righteousness, where iniquity was found.  
I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every purpose and every work.  
I reflected in my heart about the condition of humanity, that God might reveal them, and that they might see that they are like animals.  
For what happens to humanity also happens to animals; the same fate awaits them: as one dies, so dies the other; indeed, they all share the same breath; so a person has no advantage over an animal; all is vanity.  
All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all return to dust.  
Who knows the spirit of man that rises upward, and the spirit of the animal that descends to the earth?  
Therefore, I conclude that there is nothing better than for a person to find joy in their own work; for that is their lot: who can bring them to see what will come after them?
