Dead flies cause the apothecary's ointment to emit a foul odor; likewise, a small folly can tarnish the reputation of one esteemed for wisdom and honor.
A wise man's heart is positioned at his right hand, while a fool's heart is found at his left.
Indeed, when a fool walks along the way, his lack of wisdom becomes evident, and he proclaims to everyone that he is a fool.
If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not abandon your position; for yielding can quell significant offenses.
I have observed an injustice under the sun, an error that arises from the ruler:
Folly is exalted, while the wealthy occupy lowly positions.
I have seen servants riding on horses, while princes walk as servants upon the earth.
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; and whoever breaks through a hedge will be bitten by a serpent.
Whoever removes stones will be harmed by them; and he who splits wood will be endangered by it.
If the iron is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, he must exert more strength; but wisdom is valuable for guidance.
Surely, the serpent will strike without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
The words from a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will ultimately lead to his own downfall.
The beginning of his words is foolishness, and the conclusion of his speech is mischievous madness.
A fool is also full of words: a man cannot predict what will be; and who can tell what will come after him?
The toil of the foolish exhausts everyone, for he does not know how to navigate to the city.
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!
Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Through excessive laziness, the structure decays; and due to the idleness of hands, the house collapses.
A feast is made for laughter, and wine brings joy; but money answers all things.
Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts; and do not curse the rich in your private chamber: for a bird of the air will carry your voice, and that which has wings will reveal the matter.
