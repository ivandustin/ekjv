A good name is more valuable than precious ointment; and the day of death is better than the day of one's birth.
It is better to visit the house of mourning than to attend the house of feasting, for that is the fate of all people; and the living should take it to heart.
Sorrow is more beneficial than laughter, for the sadness of the countenance improves the heart.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, while the heart of fools is in the house of merriment.
It is better to heed the rebuke of the wise than to listen to the song of fools.
Just as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool; this too is vanity.
Surely oppression drives a wise man to madness, and a gift corrupts the heart.
Better is the end of a matter than its beginning; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Do not be quick to anger in your spirit, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?" for you do not inquire wisely about this.
Wisdom is valuable alongside an inheritance, and it brings profit to those who see the light of day.
For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense; but the excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who possess it.
Consider the work of God, for who can make straight what He has made crooked?
In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but in the day of adversity, reflect: God has set one against the other so that man may find nothing after him.
I have seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
Do not be overly righteous, nor make yourself excessively wise; why should you destroy yourself?
Do not be excessively wicked, nor be foolish; why should you die before your time?
It is good to hold on to this; yes, do not let go of it: for he who fears God will escape from them all.
Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men in a city.
For there is no just man on earth who does good and does not sin.
Also, do not pay attention to all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;
For often your own heart knows that you yourself have also cursed others.
All this I have tested by wisdom: I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.
What is far off and exceedingly deep? Who can find it out?
I applied my heart to know, to search, and to seek out wisdom, the reason for things, and to understand the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness.
And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is full of snares and nets, and whose hands are like chains: whoever pleases God will escape from her, but the sinner will be caught by her.
Behold, this I have found, says the preacher, counting one by one to find the account:
Yet my soul seeks but does not find: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.
Lo, this only have I discovered: that God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.
