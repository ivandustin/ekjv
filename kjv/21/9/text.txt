I contemplated all of this in my heart, deciding to express it: the righteous, the wise, and their deeds are in the hands of God. No one knows love or hatred based on what lies before them.  
All things happen to everyone alike: there is one fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the clean, as well as for the unclean; for those who sacrifice and those who do not. Just as the good is, so is the sinner; and he who swears is like he who fears an oath.  
This is a troubling reality among all that occurs under the sun: there is one fate for all. Indeed, the hearts of humanity are filled with evil, and madness resides in their hearts while they live, and afterward, they go to the dead.  
For those who are joined to all the living, there is hope: a living dog is better than a dead lion.  
The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no reward, for their memory is forgotten.  
Their love, hatred, and envy have now perished; they no longer have a share in anything that is done under the sun.  
Go your way, enjoy your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God now accepts your works.  
Let your garments always be white, and let your head lack no ointment.  
Live joyfully with the wife you love all the days of your fleeting life, which He has given you under the sun, for that is your portion in this life and in your labor under the sun.  
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave, where you are going.  
I returned and observed under the sun that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to those of understanding, nor favor to skilled individuals; rather, time and chance happen to them all.  
For man does not know his time: like fish caught in an evil net and birds trapped in a snare, so are the sons of men ensnared in an evil time that suddenly befalls them.  
This wisdom I have also observed under the sun, and it seemed significant to me:  
There was a small city with few men in it; a great king came against it, besieged it, and built strong fortifications against it.  
In that city, a poor wise man was found, and through his wisdom, he saved the city; yet no one remembered that same poor man.  
Then I said, "Wisdom is better than strength; however, the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard."  
The words of wise individuals are heard in quiet more than the shouts of a ruler among fools.  
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much good.
