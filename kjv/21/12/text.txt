Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the difficult days come, and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them."
Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars grow dim, and the clouds return after the rain:
On the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men bow down, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out the windows are darkened,
And the doors are shut in the streets, when the sound of grinding is low, and one rises at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music are brought low;
Also, when they are afraid of heights, and dangers are in the way, when the almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper becomes a burden, and desire fails: for man goes to his eternal home, and mourners walk in the streets:
Before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher shatters at the fountain, or the wheel is broken at the cistern.
Then the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity.
Moreover, because the preacher was wise, he taught the people knowledge; he carefully considered and arranged many proverbs.
The preacher sought to find acceptable words, and what was written was upright, even words of truth.
The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed by the masters of assemblies, given by one shepherd.
And further, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study is a weariness to the flesh.
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
