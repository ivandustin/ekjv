There is a troubling reality I have observed under the sun, and it is prevalent among humanity:  
A man to whom God has granted riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him the ability to enjoy it; instead, a stranger consumes it: this is futility, and it is a grievous affliction.  
If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his life are numerous, yet his soul is not satisfied with good, and he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better off than he.  
For he comes into the world in vain and departs in darkness, and his name will be enveloped in obscurity.  
Moreover, he has not seen the sun, nor experienced anything: this one finds more rest than the other.  
Indeed, even if he lives a thousand years twice over, yet he has not witnessed any good: do not all end up in the same place?  
All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.  
For what advantage does the wise have over the fool? What does the poor man possess, who knows how to walk among the living?  
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire: this too is futility and a vexation of spirit.  
That which has been is already named, and it is known that it is humanity: nor can he contend with one who is stronger than he.  
Given that there are many things that amplify futility, what benefit is there for man?  
For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his fleeting existence which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?
