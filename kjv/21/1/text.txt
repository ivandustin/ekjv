The words of the Preacher, the son of David, who reigned as king in Jerusalem.
Vanity of vanities, declares the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
What benefit does a man gain from all his labor under the sun?
One generation passes away, and another generation comes; yet the earth remains forever.
The sun rises and sets, hurrying back to the place where it rises.
The wind blows toward the south, then turns to the north; it swirls around continually, returning to its circuits.
All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place where the rivers flow, there they return again.
All things are full of labor; man cannot express it: the eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
What has been will be again; what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
Is there anything of which one might say, "Look, this is new"? It has already been here long ago, before our time.
There is no remembrance of past things; nor will there be any remembrance of things yet to come by those who will come after.
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I devoted my heart to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven; this heavy burden God has given to the sons of man to occupy themselves with.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
I said to my heart, "Look, I have attained great wisdom, surpassing all who were before me in Jerusalem; my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly; I perceived that this too is a striving after wind.
For with much wisdom comes much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
