Who is the wise man, and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the boldness of his face will change.  
I advise you to keep the king's command, and to respect the oath made to God.  
Do not be quick to leave his presence; do not stand in an evil matter, for he does whatever pleases him.  
Where the word of a king is, there is power; and who can say to him, "What are you doing?"  
Whoever keeps the commandment will experience no evil; a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.  
For every purpose, there is a time and judgment; therefore, the misery of man is great upon him.  
For he does not know what will happen; who can tell him when it will occur?  
No man has power over the spirit to retain it; nor does he have power on the day of death. There is no escape in that war, nor will wickedness save those who are devoted to it.  
I have seen all this and applied my heart to every work done under the sun: there is a time when one man rules over another to his own detriment.  
I also observed the wicked being buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy; they were forgotten in the city where they had acted: this is also vanity.  
Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to do evil.  
Though a sinner commits evil a hundred times and his days are prolonged, I know that it will be well with those who fear God, who stand in awe before Him.  
But it will not be well with the wicked, nor will he prolong his days, which are like a shadow, because he does not fear God.  
There is a vanity that occurs on the earth: just men suffer as if they were wicked, while wicked men are treated as if they were righteous; I said that this too is vanity.  
Then I commended joy, for there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him from his labor throughout the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.  
When I set my heart to know wisdom and to observe the business that is done on the earth (for there is one who neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),  
I then considered all the work of God, that a man cannot discover the work done under the sun; for even if a man labors to seek it out, he will not find it; yes, further, even if a wise man thinks he knows it, he will not be able to find it.
