Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.  
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you do not know what misfortune may come upon the earth.  
If the clouds are full of rain, they will pour themselves out upon the earth; and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will remain.  
He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.  
Just as you do not know the way of the spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman, so you do not know the works of God who creates all.  
In the morning, sow your seed, and in the evening, do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both will be equally good.  
Truly, the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun.  
But if a man lives many years and enjoys them all, let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.  
Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment.  
Therefore, remove sorrow from your heart and put away evil from your flesh, for childhood and youth are vanity.
