I returned and reflected on all the oppressions occurring under the sun. I noticed the tears of the oppressed, who had no comforter; meanwhile, their oppressors held power, yet they too had no comforter.  
Therefore, I praised the dead who have already passed away more than the living who are still alive.  
Indeed, better is he who has not yet been born, who has not witnessed the evil deeds done under the sun.  
Once more, I contemplated all the toil and every righteous deed, and I saw that for this, a man is envied by his neighbor. This too is vanity and a vexation of spirit.  
The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.  
Better is a handful of tranquility than two hands full of toil and vexation of spirit.  
Then I returned and observed vanity under the sun.  
There is one who is alone, with no second; he has neither child nor brother. Yet, there is no end to all his labor; his eyes are never satisfied with riches, and he does not ask, "For whom do I labor and deprive my soul of good?" This is also vanity; indeed, it is a grievous toil.  
Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor.  
If one falls, the other will lift him up; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he has no one to help him up.  
Again, if two lie together, they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?  
And if one can overpower him, two can withstand him; a threefold cord is not easily broken.  
Better is a poor but wise child than an old and foolish king who can no longer be admonished.  
For out of prison, he comes to reign; while he who is born into his kingdom becomes poor.  
I considered all the living who walk under the sun, along with the second child who will take his place.  
There is no end to all the people, even those who have come before them; those who come after will not rejoice in him. Surely, this too is vanity and a vexation of spirit.
