Therefore, holy brethren, participants in the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our faith, Christ Jesus;
Who was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all his house.
For this man has been deemed worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the builder of the house has more honor than the house itself.
For every house is built by someone; but the one who built all things is God.
And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, serving as a testimony to those things that were to be spoken later;
But Christ is a son over his own house; and we are that house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the rejoicing of our hope until the end.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness;
When your ancestors tested me, they tried me, and saw my works for forty years.
Therefore, I was grieved with that generation and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.'
So I swore in my anger, 'They shall not enter into my rest.'"
Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, leading you to depart from the living God.
But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;
While it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."
For some, when they heard, provoked him; yet not all who came out of Egypt through Moses.
But with whom was he grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who did not believe?
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
