Now, faith is the essence of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen.
By it, the elders received a commendable testimony.
Through faith, we comprehend that the universe was created by the word of God, so that the visible was made from the invisible.
By faith, Abel offered to God a more commendable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was affirmed as righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts; and though he is dead, he still speaks.
By faith, Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; he was not found because God had taken him; for before his removal, he had this testimony that he pleased God.
But without faith, it is impossible to please Him; for whoever approaches God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.
By faith, Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, was moved with reverence and prepared an ark for the salvation of his household; through this, he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
By faith, Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, obeyed and went out, not knowing where he was going.
By faith, he lived in the promised land as a foreigner, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
For he was looking forward to a city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
Through faith, Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she considered Him faithful who had promised.
Therefore, from one man, and him as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
All these people died in faith, without having received the promises, but having seen them from afar, they were convinced of them, embraced them, and acknowledged that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
For those who say such things clearly indicate that they are seeking a homeland.
And indeed, if they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had the opportunity to return.
But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one; therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
By faith, Abraham, when tested, offered up Isaac; he who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,
of whom it had been said, "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."
He reasoned that God could raise him from the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau regarding things to come.
By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions concerning his bones.
By faith, Moses was hidden for three months by his parents when he was born, because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
By faith, Moses, when he grew up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin;
considering the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to the reward.
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible.
By faith, he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.
By faith, they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
By faith, the walls of Jericho fell after the army had marched around them for seven days.
By faith, the prostitute Rahab was not killed with those who were disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.
And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,
who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.
Women received back their dead, raised to life again; others were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain a better resurrection.
Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.
They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted, and mistreatedâ€”
the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground.
These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised,
since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
