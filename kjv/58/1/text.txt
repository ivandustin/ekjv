God, who spoke at various times and in different ways to the ancestors through the prophets,
Has in these last days communicated to us through his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he also created the worlds;
Who is the radiance of his glory, the exact representation of his being, and sustaining all things by his powerful word; after he had provided purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven:
Having become so much superior to the angels, as he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.
For to which of the angels did he ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? And again, "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son"?
And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all the angels of God worship him."
And regarding the angels, he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
But concerning the Son, he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom."
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your companions.
And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment;
Like a robe, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will never end."
But to which of the angels did he ever say at any time, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
