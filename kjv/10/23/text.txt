Here are the edited lines:
These are the final words of David. David, the son of Jesse, spoke, and the man who was elevated on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, declared:
The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, and His word was on my tongue.
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me: He who rules over men must be just, governing in the fear of God.
He shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; like the tender grass springing up from the earth after a clear shining rain.
Although my house is not so with God, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged in all things, and certain; for this is all my salvation and all my desire, even if He does not cause it to grow.
But the sons of Belial shall all be like thorns thrust away, for they cannot be taken with hands.
The man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear; they shall be completely burned with fire in the same place.
These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite who sat in the seat, chief among the captains; this was Adino the Eznite: he raised his spear against eight hundred, whom he killed at one time.
After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they challenged the Philistines gathered for battle, and the men of Israel had fled.
He arose and struck down the Philistines until his hand grew weary, and his hand clung to the sword; and the LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned only to collect the spoils.
After him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered into a troop where there was a field full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.
But he stood in the middle of the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory.
Three of the thirty chief men went down to David during the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine troop was camped in the valley of Rephaim.
David was then in a stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem.
David longed and said, "Oh, that someone would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
The three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, took it, and brought it to David; however, he would not drink it but poured it out to the LORD.
He said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives?" Therefore, he would not drink it. These things were done by these three mighty men.
Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among the three. He lifted his spear against three hundred and killed them, earning a name among the three.
Was he not the most honorable of the three? Therefore, he was their captain; however, he did not attain to the first three.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a valiant man from Kabzeel, performed many great deeds; he killed two lion-like men of Moab: he also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day.
He killed an Egyptian, a handsome man; the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff, took the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
These things were done by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he earned a name among the three mighty men.
He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. David appointed him over his guard.
Asahel, the brother of Joab, was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,
Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armor-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,
Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in total.
