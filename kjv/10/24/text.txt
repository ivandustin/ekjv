And once more, the anger of the LORD was ignited against Israel, prompting Him to incite David to say, "Go, take a census of Israel and Judah."  
The king instructed Joab, the commander of his army, who was with him, "Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, so that I may know their number."  
Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God increase the people a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why does my lord the king take pleasure in this?"  
Despite Joab's objections, the king's command prevailed over Joab and the commanders of the army. Joab and the commanders left the king's presence to count the people of Israel.  
They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer.  
Then they traveled to Gilead and the land of Tahtimhodshi; they reached Danjaan and approached Zidon.  
They arrived at the stronghold of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites, and they went southward to Judah, even to Beersheba.  
After surveying the entire land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  
Joab reported the total number of people to the king: there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah numbered five hundred thousand.  
David's heart was troubled after he had counted the people. He said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done; now, I plead with you, O LORD, take away the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."  
In the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,  
"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options; choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"  
So Gad went to David and said, "Shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land? Or will you flee for three months before your enemies while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now consider and decide what answer I should return to Him who sent me."  
David replied to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for His mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."  
So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men died from Dan to Beersheba.  
When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.  
David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel striking down the people, and he said, "I have sinned; I have done wrong. These sheep, what have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family."  
That day, Gad came to David and said, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."  
David followed Gad's instructions and went up as the LORD commanded.  
Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants approaching him, and he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.  
Araunah asked, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David replied, "To buy your threshing floor, so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be halted."  
Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up; here are oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and yokes for the wood."  
All these things Araunah, as a king, gave to the king. He said to David, "May the LORD your God accept you."  
But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it for a price; I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.  
David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Thus, the LORD was moved by the prayer for the land, and the plague was halted in Israel.
