There was a prolonged conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David; however, David grew stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker.
David had sons born to him in Hebron, and his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess.
His second son was Chileab, by Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom, the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
The fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.
The sixth son was Ithream, by Eglah, David's wife. These were the children born to David in Hebron.
During the ongoing war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner strengthened his position for the house of Saul.
Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, and Ishbosheth confronted Abner, asking why he had gone in to his father's concubine.
Abner was furious at Ishbosheth's words and replied, "Am I a dog's head? I have shown kindness today to the house of Saul, your father, his brothers, and his friends, and I have not delivered you into David's hands. Why then do you accuse me of wrongdoing regarding this woman?"
May God deal with Abner, and more so, unless I do for David what the LORD has sworn to him;
to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.
Ishbosheth could not respond to Abner because he was afraid of him.
Abner sent messengers to David, asking, "Whose is the land?" He also said, "Make a covenant with me, and my hand will be with you to unite all Israel to you."
David replied, "I will make a covenant with you, but one thing I require: You must not see my face unless you bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."
David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I married for a hundred Philistine foreskins."
Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, Phaltiel, the son of Laish.
Her husband followed her, weeping as he went to Bahurim. Abner told him, "Go back," and he returned.
Abner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, "In the past, you sought David to be king over you.
Now do it, for the LORD has spoken concerning David, saying, 'By my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and all their enemies.'"
Abner also spoke to the tribe of Benjamin and then went to David in Hebron to communicate what seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
Abner came to David in Hebron with twenty men, and David made a feast for Abner and his men.
Abner said to David, "I will rise and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so they may make a covenant with you, and you may reign over all that your heart desires." David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
Meanwhile, David's servants and Joab returned from pursuing a troop, bringing a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, as David had sent him away in peace.
When Joab and his men arrived, they informed Joab that Abner, the son of Ner, had come to the king and had been sent away in peace.
Joab approached the king and asked, "What have you done? Abner came to you; why did you send him away? He has gone in peace."
"You know that Abner, the son of Ner, came to deceive you, to learn your comings and goings, and to know all that you do."
After Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David was unaware of it.
When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate to speak with him privately and struck him under the fifth rib, killing him for the blood of Asahel, his brother.
Later, when David heard of it, he declared, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever regarding the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.
Let the guilt rest on Joab and his father's house; may there not be a single male in Joab's house who has a discharge, is a leper, leans on a staff, falls by the sword, or lacks bread."
Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon during the battle.
David instructed Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn for Abner." King David himself followed the bier.
They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king raised his voice and wept at Abner's grave, and all the people wept.
The king lamented over Abner, saying, "Did Abner die like a fool?
Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters; you fell as a man falls before wicked men." All the people wept again for him.
When the people urged David to eat while it was still day, he swore, "May God deal with me, and more so, if I eat bread or anything else until the sun sets."
All the people noticed this and were pleased, as everything the king did pleased them.
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's intention to kill Abner, the son of Ner.
The king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
I am weak today, though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The LORD will repay the evildoer according to his wickedness."
