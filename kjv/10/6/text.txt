Once again, David assembled all the chosen men of Israel, totaling thirty thousand.  
David rose and set out with all the people accompanying him from Baale of Judah to retrieve the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts, who dwells between the cherubim.  
They placed the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, with Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, driving the new cart.  
As they transported the ark of God from the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, Ahio went ahead of the ark.  
David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD with various instruments made of fir wood, including harps, psalteries, timbrels, cornets, and cymbals.  
When they reached Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark of God, for the oxen stumbled.  
The anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error, resulting in his death beside the ark of God.  
David was displeased because the LORD had inflicted a breach upon Uzzah, and he named the place Perezuzzah, which remains to this day.  
That day, David was afraid of the LORD and asked, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"  
Consequently, David decided not to bring the ark of the LORD into the city of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obededom the Gittite.  
The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obededom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obededom and his entire household.  
Word reached King David that the LORD had blessed the house of Obededom and all that belonged to him because of the ark of God. So David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obededom to the city of David with great joy.  
As those carrying the ark of the LORD took six steps, David sacrificed oxen and fatlings.  
David danced before the LORD with all his might, wearing a linen ephod.  
Thus, David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets.  
As the ark of the LORD entered the city of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; she despised him in her heart.  
They brought the ark of the LORD in and placed it in the center of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it. David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.  
Once David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.  
He distributed to all the people, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a flagon of wine. Then everyone departed to their homes.  
David returned to bless his household, and Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet him, saying, "How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself in the sight of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"  
David replied to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. Therefore, I will celebrate before the LORD.  
I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humble in my own sight; but as for the maidservants you mentioned, I will be honored by them."  
Consequently, Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children until the day of her death.
