And David asked, "Is there anyone left from the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"  
There was a servant from the house of Saul named Ziba. When they called him to David, the king asked, "Are you Ziba?" He replied, "I am your servant."  
The king inquired, "Is there anyone from the house of Saul to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered, "Jonathan has a son who is lame in both feet."  
The king asked, "Where is he?" Ziba replied, "He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar."  
King David then sent for him and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.  
When Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and the grandson of Saul, came to David, he fell on his face and showed reverence. David called out, "Mephibosheth!" He answered, "Here is your servant!"  
David said to him, "Do not be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table."  
Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?"  
Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.  
You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops so that your master's grandson may be provided for. Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, will always eat at my table." Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.  
Ziba replied to the king, "Your servant will do whatever my lord the king has commanded." The king said, "Mephibosheth will eat at my table like one of the king's sons."  
Mephibosheth had a young son named Micha, and all who lived in Ziba's household were servants to Mephibosheth.  
So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the king's table, and he was lame in both feet.
