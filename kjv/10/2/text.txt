And it came to pass after this that David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said unto him, "Go up." David then asked, "Whither shall I go up?" And He replied, "Unto Hebron."

So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 

David brought his men with him, each man with his household, and they settled in the cities of Hebron. 

The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David as king over the house of Judah. They informed David that the men of Jabeshgilead were the ones who buried Saul. 

David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, saying, "Blessed be you of the LORD, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him." 

"And now may the LORD show you kindness and truth; and I will also repay you this kindness because you have done this thing." 

"Therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant, for your master Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them." 

But Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and brought him to Mahanaim. 

He made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel. 

Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. However, the house of Judah followed David. 

The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 

Abner, the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 

Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out and met together by the pool of Gibeon; they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the opposite side. 

Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men arise and play before us." Joab replied, "Let them arise." 

Then twelve young men from Benjamin, belonging to Ishbosheth, and twelve from the servants of David arose and approached each other. 

They caught hold of one another by the head and thrust their swords into each other's sides, so they fell down together. Therefore, that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 

There was a fierce battle that day; Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David. 

There were three sons of Zeruiah present: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as swift as a gazelle. 

Asahel pursued Abner, and in his pursuit, he did not turn to the right or to the left. 

Abner looked back and asked, "Are you Asahel?" He answered, "I am." 

Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his armor." But Asahel refused to turn aside from following him. 

Abner again said to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me; why should I strike you to the ground? How could I face Joab, your brother?" 

However, Asahel refused to turn aside, so Abner struck him with the back end of his spear under the fifth rib, and the spear came out behind him. He fell and died on the spot, and all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died stood still. 

Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and the sun set as they reached the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah, along the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 

The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner and formed one troop, standing on the top of a hill. 

Then Abner called to Joab, saying, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitterness in the end? How long will it be before you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?" 

Joab replied, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely by morning the people would have ceased pursuing their brothers." 

So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, ceasing to pursue Israel and fighting no more. 

Abner and his men walked all night through the plain, crossed the Jordan, went through all Bithron, and arrived at Mahanaim. 

Joab returned from pursuing Abner, and when he had gathered all the people together, there were nineteen men and Asahel missing from David's servants. 

But the servants of David had struck down three hundred and sixty men of Benjamin and Abner's men. 

They took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men traveled all night and arrived in Hebron at dawn.
