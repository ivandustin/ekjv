And David counted the people who were with him, appointing captains over thousands and captains over hundreds.
David divided the people into three groups: one under Joab, another under Abishai, the son of Zeruiah (Joab's brother), and the last under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the people, "I will surely go with you myself."
But the people replied, "You must not go out with us; for if we flee, they will not care about us; and if half of us die, they will not care about us either. You are worth ten thousand of us; it is better for you to help us from the city."
The king responded, "I will do what seems best to you." He stood by the gate, and all the people exited by hundreds and thousands.
The king instructed Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, "Be gentle for my sake with the young man, Absalom." All the people heard the king give the captains this charge concerning Absalom.
The people went out to the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
The servants of David struck down the people of Israel, and there was a great slaughter that day, with twenty thousand men killed.
The battle spread across the entire region, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword did.
Absalom encountered the servants of David. He was riding a mule, which went under the thick branches of a large oak. His head got caught in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule beneath him ran away.
A certain man saw this and reported it to Joab, saying, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
Joab asked the man, "You saw him? Why didn't you strike him down right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt."
The man replied to Joab, "Even if I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lay a hand on the king's son. We heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'Beware that no one touches the young man Absalom.'
If I had acted against my own life, it would have been a betrayal, for nothing is hidden from the king, and you would have set yourself against me."
Joab then said, "I cannot delay with you." He took three javelins in his hand and thrust them through Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak.
Ten young men who carried Joab's armor surrounded Absalom and struck him down, killing him.
Joab blew the trumpet, and the people stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab had restrained them.
They took Absalom and threw him into a large pit in the forest, piling a massive heap of stones over him. All Israel fled, each to their own tent.
During his lifetime, Absalom had erected a pillar for himself in the king's valley, saying, "I have no son to keep my name alive." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's place to this day.
Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, "Let me run and bring the king news of how the LORD has avenged him on his enemies."
Joab replied, "You will not bring news today; you will bring news another day. Today, you will not bring news because the king's son is dead."
Joab then told Cushi, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." Cushi bowed to Joab and ran.
Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, urged Joab again, "Please let me also run after Cushi." Joab asked, "Why do you want to run, my son, when you have no news ready?"
But he insisted, "Let me run." Joab said, "Run." So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and outran Cushi.
David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall. He lifted his eyes and saw a man running alone.
The watchman called out and told the king. The king said, "If he is alone, he brings news." As the man approached, he drew near.
The watchman saw another man running and called to the porter, saying, "Look, another man is running alone." The king said, "He also brings news."
The watchman said, "The running of the first man looks like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok." The king said, "He is a good man and comes with good news."
Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, "All is well." He fell to the ground before the king and said, "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king."
The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz replied, "When Joab sent the king's servant and me, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I did not know what it was."
The king said to him, "Turn aside and stand here." So he turned aside and stood still.
Then Cushi arrived and said, "Tidings, my lord the king! The LORD has avenged you today of all who rose up against you."
The king asked Cushi, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Cushi replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise against you to harm you be like that young man."
The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate, weeping. As he went, he said, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
