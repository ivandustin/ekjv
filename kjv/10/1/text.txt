After the death of Saul, it came to pass that David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed two days in Ziklag.  
On the third day, a man emerged from Saul's camp, his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he approached David, he fell to the ground in reverence.  
David asked him, "Where do you come from?" The man replied, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."  
David inquired, "What happened? Please tell me." The man answered, "The people have fled from the battle, many are fallen and dead; Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."  
David asked the young man, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?"  
The young man explained, "As I happened upon Mount Gilboa, I saw Saul leaning on his spear, with chariots and horsemen pursuing him closely.  
When he looked back and saw me, he called out to me, and I answered, 'Here I am.'  
He asked me, 'Who are you?' I replied, 'I am an Amalekite.'  
He then said, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for I am in great anguish, yet my life remains in me.'  
So I stood over him and killed him, knowing he could not survive after falling. I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm and brought them to my lord."  
David grasped his clothes and tore them, and all the men with him did the same.  
They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, for Jonathan his son, for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.  
David asked the young man, "Where are you from?" He replied, "I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."  
David questioned him, "How were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"  
David called one of the young men and said, "Go near and strike him down." The young man struck him, and he died.  
David declared, "Your blood is on your own head; your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'"  
David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  
(He also instructed them to teach the children of Judah the use of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  
"The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places; how the mighty have fallen!  
Do not tell it in Gath, do not publish it in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  
O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was cast away, the shield of Saul, as if he had not been anointed with oil.  
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.  
Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death, they were not separated; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  
Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and adorned you with gold ornaments.  
How the mighty have fallen in the midst of battle! O Jonathan, you were slain on your high places.  
I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; you were very dear to me; your love for me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women.  
How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished!
