Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."  
In the past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel in and out: and the LORD said to you, "You shall shepherd my people Israel, and you shall be a leader over Israel."  
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David as king over Israel.  
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for forty years.  
In Hebron, he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem, he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.  
The king and his men went to Jerusalem to confront the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, "You will not enter here unless you remove the blind and the lame," thinking, "David cannot enter here."  
Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion; that is the city of David.  
On that day, David declared, "Whoever climbs up the water shaft and strikes down the Jebusites, the blind and the lame whom I despise, he shall be chief and captain." Therefore, they said, "The blind and the lame shall not enter the house."  
So David settled in the stronghold and called it the city of David. He built around it from Millo inward.  
David continued to grow stronger, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.  
Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.  
David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.  
David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.  
These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammuah, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  
Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia,  
And Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.  
When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, they all went up to search for David; and David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.  
The Philistines also came and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.  
David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" The LORD answered David, "Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand."  
David went to Baalperazim and struck them there, saying, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breakthrough of water." Therefore, he named that place Baalperazim.  
They left their idols there, and David and his men burned them.  
The Philistines came up again and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.  
When David inquired of the LORD, He said, "You shall not go up; but circle around behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees.  
And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall act quickly, for then the LORD will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines."  
David did as the LORD commanded him and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gazer.
