And it came to pass, after the year had ended, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, along with his servants and all of Israel; they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. However, David remained in Jerusalem.

One evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king's house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold.

David sent and inquired about the woman. One said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"

David sent messengers to take her, and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was purified from her uncleanness; then she returned to her house.

The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am with child."

David sent to Joab, saying, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." Joab sent Uriah to David.

When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing, how the people were, and how the war was progressing.

David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." Uriah left the king's house, and a portion of food from the king followed him.

But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house.

When they told David that Uriah did not go down to his house, David asked Uriah, "Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"

Uriah replied to David, "The ark, Israel, and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Should I then go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As you live and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."

David said to Uriah, "Stay here today as well, and tomorrow I will let you depart." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.

When David called him, he ate and drank in his presence, and David made him drunk. In the evening, Uriah went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.

In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

In the letter, he wrote, "Place Uriah at the forefront of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die."

When Joab observed the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew valiant men were stationed.

The men of the city came out and fought against Joab, and some of the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died.

Then Joab sent and told David all the details concerning the war.

He instructed the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling the king all the matters of the war, if the king's anger rises and he asks you, 'Why did you approach so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?'

'Who struck down Abimelech, the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"

So the messenger went and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to say.

The messenger said to David, "Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.

The archers shot from the wall at your servants, and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."

Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it, and encourage him.'"

When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.

After the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
