When Saul's son learned of Abner's death in Hebron, his hands grew weak, and all the Israelites were filled with fear.
Saul's son had two captains: one was named Baanah, and the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon, a Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin (for Beeroth was also considered part of Benjamin).
The Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as sojourners to this day.
Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when news of Saul and Jonathan's death came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went to the house of Ishbosheth around midday while he was lying on his bed.
They entered the house as if they were there to fetch wheat, but they struck him under the fifth rib; then Rechab and Baanah, his brother, escaped.
When they entered the house, he was lying in his bed in his bedroom. They struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, fleeing through the plain all night.
They brought Ishbosheth's head to David in Hebron and said to the king, "Look, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; the LORD has avenged my lord the king today on Saul and his descendants."
David responded to Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul from all adversity,
when someone told me, 'Saul is dead,' thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, assuming I would reward him for his tidings.
How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house, on his bed? Should I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth?"
David commanded his young men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hung them over the pool in Hebron. However, they buried Ishbosheth's head in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.
