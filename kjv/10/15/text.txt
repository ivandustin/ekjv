And it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared chariots and horses, along with fifty men to run before him.  
Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man with a controversy came to the king for judgment, Absalom called to him and asked, "Of what city are you?" The man replied, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."  
Absalom said to him, "See, your matters are good and right, but there is no one appointed by the king to hear you."  
Absalom added, "Oh, that I were made judge in the land! Then every man with a suit or cause could come to me, and I would give him justice!"  
Whenever any man approached him to pay respect, he would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.  
In this manner, Absalom acted toward all of Israel who came to the king for judgment, thus stealing the hearts of the men of Israel.  
After forty years, Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and fulfill my vow, which I have made to the LORD in Hebron."  
"For your servant made a vow while I was in Geshur, Syria, saying, 'If the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'"  
The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron.  
But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, declare, 'Absalom reigns in Hebron!'"  
With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited; they went in their simplicity, unaware of anything.  
Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. The conspiracy grew strong, as the people continued to increase with Absalom.  
A messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."  
David said to all his servants with him in Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee; otherwise, we will not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us, striking the city with the edge of the sword."  
The king's servants replied, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king commands."  
The king went out, and all his household followed him. He left ten women, who were concubines, to take care of the house.  
The king went out, and all the people followed him, stopping at a distance.  
All his servants passed by him, including the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the Gittites—six hundred men who had come from Gath—who passed on before the king.  
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why are you also going with us? Return to your place and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and an exile.  
You came only yesterday; should I make you wander with us today? I am going wherever I can; return and take your brothers with you. May mercy and truth be with you."  
Ittai answered the king, saying, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king is, whether in death or life, there also will your servant be."  
David said to Ittai, "Go and cross over." So Ittai the Gittite crossed over, along with all his men and the little ones with him.  
The entire country wept loudly, and all the people crossed over. The king also crossed over the brook Kidron, and all the people moved toward the wilderness.  
And behold, Zadok and all the Levites were with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had passed out of the city.  
The king said to Zadok, "Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place.  
But if He says, 'I have no delight in you,' here I am; let Him do to me as seems good to Him."  
The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, you and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  
I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until I receive word from you to inform me."  
Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they stayed there.  
David went up the ascent of Mount Olivet, weeping as he went, with his head covered and barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.  
One told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." David prayed, "O LORD, I ask You to turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."  
When David reached the top of the mount where he worshiped God, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dust on his head.  
David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.  
But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant until now, so I will now also be your servant,' then you can defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.  
And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you? Therefore, whatever you hear from the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  
Behold, they have their two sons with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; by them, you shall send me everything you hear."  
So Hushai, David's friend, entered the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
