But concerning the times and seasons, brethren, you have no need for me to write to you.  
For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.  
When they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come upon them, like labor pains upon a pregnant woman; and they will not escape.  
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that day should not overtake you like a thief.  
You are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.  
Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch and be sober.  
For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk are drunk at night.  
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.  
For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
Who died for us, so that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.  
Therefore, comfort one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.  
And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, who are over you in the Lord, and who admonish you;  
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.  
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient with everyone.  
See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone; but
