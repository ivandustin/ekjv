Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be unto you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.  
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, your labor of love, and your patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God our Father.  
Knowing, beloved brethren, your election of God.  
For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.  
And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit.  
So that you became examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.  
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has spread abroad; so that we need not to say anything.  
For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.  
And to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.
