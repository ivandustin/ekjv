When we could no longer endure the situation, we decided it was best to remain in Athens alone;  
We sent Timotheus, our brother, a minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith;  
So that no one would be shaken by these trials, for you yourselves know that we are destined for this.  
Indeed, when we were with you, we warned you that we would face tribulations; and it has happened, as you know.  
For this reason, when I could no longer bear it, I sent to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter might have tempted you, and our efforts would be in vain.  
But now that Timotheus has returned to us from you, bringing us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have fond memories of us, longing to see us, just as we long to see you:  
Therefore, brothers, we were comforted about you in all our afflictions and distress because of your faith:  
For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.  
What thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy we feel for your sake in the presence of our God;  
Praying earnestly night and day that we may see your face and supply what is lacking in your faith?  
Now may God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, clear the way for us to come to you.  
And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for all people, just as we do for you:  
So that he may strengthen your hearts, making them blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
