Here is a revised version of each line for clarity and modern language:
But there were false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
And many will follow their harmful ways; as a result, the way of truth will be maligned.
Through greed, they will exploit you with fabricated words: their judgment has long been hanging over them, and their destruction is not asleep.
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell and bound them in chains of darkness, reserving them for judgment;
And did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, bringing the flood upon the ungodly world;
And turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, condemning them with an overthrow, making them an example for those who would live ungodly lives afterward;
And rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked;
(For that righteous man, living among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by their unlawful deeds;)
The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;
Especially those who follow the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed, not afraid to slander celestial beings.
Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring slanderous accusations against them before the Lord.
But these false teachers, like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of things they do not understand; and in their destruction, they will also be destroyed;
They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done; they consider it pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. They are blemishes and spots, reveling in their deception while they feast with you;
With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed; they are accursed children.
They have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness;
But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey that spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
These false teachers are springs without water, clouds driven by a storm; for them, the gloom of darkness has been reserved forever.
For when they speak arrogant words of vanity, they entice by sensual desires and the lure of the flesh those who have barely escaped from those living in error.
While they promise them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for a person is a slave to whatever has mastered them.
For if they have escaped the corruption of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.
It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then turned back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
What has happened to them is true of the proverb: "A dog returns to its vomit," and "A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud."
