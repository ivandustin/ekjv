Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:
Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
As his divine power has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who has called us to glory and virtue:
By which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
And to knowledge self-control; and to self-control patience; and to patience godliness;
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.
For if these things are in you and abound, they will make you neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But he who lacks these things is blind and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things, you shall never stumble:
For so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Therefore, I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know them and are established in the present truth.
Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;
Knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me.
Moreover, I will be diligent that you may be able, after my departure, to have these things always in remembrance.
For we did not follow cleverly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts:
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation.
For prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
