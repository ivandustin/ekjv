Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, writes to those who have obtained a faith of equal value with ours through the righteousness of God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.  
May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.  
According to His divine power, He has granted us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us to glory and virtue.
