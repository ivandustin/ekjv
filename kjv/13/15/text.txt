And David built houses in the city of David, prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.  
Then David declared, "Only the Levites should carry the ark of God, for the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark and to minister to Him forever."  
David gathered all of Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.  
He assembled the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:  
From the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, along with his hundred and twenty brethren.  
From the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, along with his two hundred and twenty brethren.  
From the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, along with his hundred and thirty brethren.  
From the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, along with his two hundred brethren.  
From the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, along with his eighty brethren.  
From the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, along with his hundred and twelve brethren.  
David called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and for the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,  
and said to them, "You are the leaders of the Levite families: sanctify yourselves, along with your brethren, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it."  
"Because you did not do this at first, the LORD our God broke out against us, for we did not seek Him according to the prescribed order."  
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.  
The children of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the staves, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.  
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren as singers with musical instruments: psalteries, harps, and cymbals, to sound joyfully.  
The Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and his brethren: Asaph the son of Berechiah, and from the sons of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Kushaiah.  
With them were their brethren of the second degree: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.  
The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound the cymbals of brass;  
and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played the psalteries on Alamoth;  
and Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, Jeiel, and Azaziah played the harps on the Sheminith to excel.  
Chenaniah, the chief of the Levites, was in charge of the singing, for he was skillful in this.  
Berechiah and Elkanah served as doorkeepers for the ark.  
Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethaneel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God, while Obededom and Jehiah served as doorkeepers for the ark.  
So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obededom with joy.  
When God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.  
David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who carried the ark, along with the singers and Chenaniah, the master of the song, wore linen as well; David also wore a linen ephod.  
Thus, all of Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the cornet, trumpets, and cymbals, making a joyful noise with psalteries and harps.  
As the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the city of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked out from a window and saw King David dancing and playing; she despised him in her heart.
