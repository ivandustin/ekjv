Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar for the burnt offerings for Israel."
And David commanded that the foreigners in the land of Israel be gathered together; he appointed masons to cut hewn stones for building the house of God.
David prepared an abundance of iron for the nails for the gates and for the joints, and he gathered brass in great quantities without weighing it.
He also collected cedar trees in abundance, for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought much cedar wood to David.
David said, "Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, renowned and glorious throughout all countries. Therefore, I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death.
Then he called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
David said to Solomon, "My son, it was in my heart to build a house for the name of the LORD my God.
But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood and fought great battles; you shall not build a house for my name, because you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight.'
Behold, a son will be born to you who will be a man of peace; I will give him rest from all his enemies around him. His name shall be Solomon, and I will grant peace and tranquility to Israel during his reign.
He shall build a house for my name; he will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.
Now, my son, may the LORD be with you; may you prosper and build the house of the LORD your God, as He has promised you.
Only may the LORD grant you wisdom and understanding, and may He give you charge concerning Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
Then you will prosper if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or dismayed.
Now, behold, in my distress, I have prepared for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, along with brass and iron in such quantities that they cannot be weighed; for they are in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone, and you may add to them.
Moreover, there are skilled workers with you in abundance, stonecutters and carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen for every kind of work.
Of the gold, silver, brass, and iron, there is no limit. Arise therefore, and be doing, and may the LORD be with you."
David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to assist his son Solomon, saying,
"Is not the LORD your God with you? Has He not given you rest on every side? For He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and His people.
Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD."
