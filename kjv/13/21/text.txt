And Satan rose up against Israel, inciting David to take a census of the people.
David instructed Joab and the leaders of the people, "Go and count Israel from Beersheba to Dan; then report back to me the total number so that I may know it."
Joab replied, "May the LORD increase His people a hundred times more than they are! But, my lord the king, are they not all your servants? Why then does my lord seek this? Why should he bring guilt upon Israel?"
Despite Joab's objections, the king's command prevailed. Consequently, Joab left and traveled throughout all Israel, eventually returning to Jerusalem.
Joab reported the total number of the people to David: there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword in Israel, and four hundred seventy thousand men who drew the sword in Judah.
However, he did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the count, as the king's command was detestable to Joab.
God was displeased with this action, and as a result, He struck Israel.
David confessed to God, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Please, I beg You, remove the guilt of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
The LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
"Go and tell David, 'The LORD says: I am offering you three options; choose one of them for Me to carry out.'"
So Gad approached David and said, "The LORD says: Choose one of the following:
Either three years of famine, or three months of being defeated by your enemies while they pursue you, or three days of the sword of the LORD, a plague in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now consider what answer I should give to Him who sent me."
David replied to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."
So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as the angel was about to destroy it, the LORD saw and relented from the calamity, saying to the angel, "It is enough; withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the elders of Israel, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the census? I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, let Your hand be against me and my father's house, but do not let the plague be upon Your people."
Then the angel of the LORD instructed Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
David went up at Gad's command, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.
Ornan turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves, as Ornan was threshing wheat.
When David approached Ornan, he looked and saw David, and he went out from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the ground.
David said to Ornan, "Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price, so that I may build an altar to the LORD there, and the plague may be halted from the people."
Ornan replied to David, "Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Here are the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all."
But King David said to Ornan, "No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
The LORD commanded the angel, and he sheathed his sword.
At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
