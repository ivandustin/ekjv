Moreover, David and the captains of the host separated for the service of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, psalteries, and cymbals. The number of the workmen according to their service was as follows:

Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph, under the leadership of Asaph, who prophesied according to the king's order.

Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun were Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six in total, under the guidance of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and praise to the LORD.

Of Heman: the sons of Heman included Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 

All these were the sons of Heman, the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God granted Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

All these were under the guidance of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
