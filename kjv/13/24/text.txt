Here are the edited lines:

Now, these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
However, Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children; therefore, Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly duties.  
David assigned them, with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar, according to their roles in service.  
There were more chief men among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, and thus they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar, there were sixteen chief men from their families, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to their families.  
They were divided by lot, one group against another; for the leaders of the sanctuary and the leaders of the house of God were from the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.  
Shemaiah, the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, recorded them before the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites: one principal household was chosen for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar.  
The first lot was drawn for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah,  
The third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim,  
The fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin,  
The seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah,  
The ninth for Jeshuah, the tenth for Shecaniah,  
The eleventh for Eliashib, the twelfth for Jakim,  
The thirteenth for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab,  
The fifteenth for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer,  
The seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Aphses,  
The nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezekel,  
The twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul,  
The twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.  
These were their assignments in service to enter the house of the LORD, according to their order, under Aaron their father, as commanded by the LORD God of Israel.  
The remaining sons of Levi were as follows: From the sons of Amram, Shubael; from the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.  
Regarding Rehabiah: from the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.  
From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.  
The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  
From the sons of Uzziel: Michah; from the sons of Michah, Shamir.  
The brother of Michah was Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.  
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; from the sons of Jaaziah, Beno.  
The sons of Merari by Jaaziah were Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.  
From Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.  
Regarding Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.  
The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their family lines.  
They also cast lots alongside their brothers, the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, with the principal fathers opposite their younger brothers.
