Now Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with timber from cedars, masons, and carpenters, to construct a house for him.  
David recognized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted because of his people Israel.  
In Jerusalem, David took more wives and fathered additional sons and daughters.  
These are the names of his children born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  
as well as Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpalet,  
and Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia,  
and Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet.  
When the Philistines learned that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went up to confront David. David heard of this and went out to meet them.  
The Philistines came and positioned themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  
David inquired of God, asking, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" The LORD answered him, "Go up, for I will deliver them into your hand."  
They advanced to Baalperazim, and David struck them there. David declared, "God has burst forth upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking of waters." Therefore, that place was named Baalperazim.  
After they left their gods there, David commanded that they be burned with fire.  
The Philistines once again spread out in the valley.  
Consequently, David sought God again, and God instructed him, "Do not pursue them; turn away from them and approach them opposite the mulberry trees.  
When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the Philistine army."  
David followed God's command, and they defeated the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gazer.  
The fame of David spread throughout all lands, and the LORD instilled fear of him in all nations.
