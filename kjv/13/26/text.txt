Concerning the divisions of the porters: Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, was of the Korhites, and he was among the sons of Asaph.  
The sons of Meshelemiah included Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, and Jathniel the fourth.  
Elam was the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Elioenai the seventh.  
The sons of Obededom were Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.  
Ammiel was the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peulthai the eighth, for God blessed him.  
Shemaiah, his son, had sons who ruled in their father's house, for they were mighty men of valor.  
The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men: Elihu and Semachiah.  
All these were the sons of Obededom; they, along with their sons and brothers, were capable men, totaling sixty-two of Obededom.  
Meshelemiah had sons and brothers who were strong men, numbering eighteen.  
Hosah, of the children of Merari, also had sons: Simri the chief (though he was not the firstborn, his father made him chief),  
Hilkiah was the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth; all the sons and brothers of Hosah totaled thirteen.  
Among these were the divisions of the porters, including the chief men, who had wards opposite one another to minister in the house of the LORD.  
They cast lots, both small and great, according to the houses of their fathers, for every gate.  
The lot for the eastward gate fell to Shelemiah. For Zechariah, his wise son, they cast lots, and his lot came out for the northward gate.  
Obededom received the southward lot, and to his sons was assigned the house of Asuppim.  
The lot for Shuppim and Hosah came forth for the westward gate, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the ascent, ward against ward.  
Eastward, there were six Levites; northward, four each day; southward, four each day; and toward Asuppim, two and two.  
At Parbar westward, there were four at the causeway and two at Parbar.  
These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore and the sons of Merari.  
Of the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of the treasures of the house of God and the treasures of the dedicated things.  
Regarding the sons of Laadan, the chief fathers of the Gershonite Laadan were Jehieli.  
The sons of Jehieli were Zetham and Joel, his brother, who were in charge of the treasures of the house of the LORD.  
Among the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites:  
Shebuel, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was the ruler of the treasures.  
His brothers by Eliezer were Rehabiah, Jeshaiah, Joram, Zichri, and Shelomith.  
Shelomith and his brothers were responsible for all the treasures of the dedicated things, which King David, the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host had dedicated.  
They dedicated from the spoils won in battles to maintain the house of the LORD.  
All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated was under the oversight of Shelomith and his brothers.  
Among the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were responsible for the outward business over Israel, serving as officers and judges.  
Among the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, valiant men numbering one thousand seven hundred, served as officers among the Israelites on this side of the Jordan, westward, in all matters of the LORD and in the service of the king.  
Among the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of King David's reign, they were sought out and found to be mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.  
His brothers, valiant men, numbered two thousand seven hundred chief fathers, whom King David appointed as rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for all matters pertaining to God and the affairs of the king.
