David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, as well as every leader.
David addressed the entire congregation of Israel, saying, "If it seems good to you and is in accordance with the LORD our God, let us send word to our brethren everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and suburbs, so they may gather together with us.
Let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of it during the days of Saul."
All the congregation agreed to this proposal, for it was right in the eyes of the people.
So David gathered all of Israel, from Shihor in Egypt to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
David and all of Israel went up to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim, belonging to Judah, to bring up the ark of God, the LORD, who dwells between the cherubim, whose name is invoked.
They transported the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, with Uzza and Ahio driving the cart.
David and all of Israel celebrated before God with all their might, accompanied by singing, harps, psalteries, timbrels, cymbals, and trumpets.
When they reached the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza reached out his hand to steady the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
The anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and He struck him down because he touched the ark; and he died there before God.
David was displeased because the LORD had made a breach against Uzza; therefore, that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"
So David did not bring the ark home to himself in the city of David, but instead took it to the house of Obededom the Gittite.
The ark of God remained in the house of Obededom for three months, and the LORD blessed Obededom and all that he had.
