And it came to pass that after the year had ended, at the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the army's forces and devastated the land of the Ammonites, and he besieged Rabbah. However, David remained in Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it.

David took the crown of their king from his head and discovered it weighed a talent of gold, adorned with precious stones; it was placed upon David's head. He also brought back an immense amount of plunder from the city.

He brought out the people who were in it and cut them with saws, iron harrows, and axes. Thus, David treated all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

After this, a war arose at Gezer with the Philistines; during this time, Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued.

There was another battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear shaft was like a weaver's beam.

Once again, there was a battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes—six on each hand and six on each foot—and he was also a descendant of the giants.

But when he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.

These were born to the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants.
