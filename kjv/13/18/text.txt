Now, after this, it came to pass that David struck the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its towns from the Philistines.
He also struck Moab; the Moabites then became David's servants and brought him gifts.
David defeated Hadarezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath, while establishing his dominion by the Euphrates River.
From him, David took a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers; he also hamstrung all the chariot horses but kept a hundred chariots for himself.
When the Syrians of Damascus came to assist Hadarezer, king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand of the Syrians.
Then David placed garrisons in Damascus, and the Syrians became David's servants, bringing him gifts. Thus, the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
David took the gold shields that belonged to the servants of Hadarezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
From Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought back a great deal of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze sea, the pillars, and various bronze vessels.
When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadarezer,
he sent his son Hadoram to King David to inquire about his well-being and to congratulate him for fighting against Hadarezer and defeating him (for Hadarezer had been at war with Tou), bringing with him various vessels of gold, silver, and bronze.
King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations: Edom, Moab, the children of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek.
Additionally, Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
He established garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus, the LORD preserved David wherever he went.
So David reigned over all Israel, administering judgment and justice among all his people.
Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was in command of the army, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, served as recorder.
Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests, and Shavsha was the scribe.
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were chief officials around the king.
