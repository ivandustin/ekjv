Coz begat Anub, Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel, the son of Harum.
Jabez was more honorable than his brothers; his mother named him Jabez, saying, "Because I bore him in sorrow."

They found fat and good pasture; the land was wide, quiet, and peaceful, for they of Ham had dwelt there of old.
These written by name came in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and struck their tents and the habitations found there, destroying them utterly to this day, and dwelt in their rooms because there was pasture there for their flocks.
