They brought the ark of God and placed it in the center of the tent that David had pitched for it; they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.  
After David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.  
He distributed to every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a good piece of meat, and a flagon of wine.  
David appointed certain Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to record, thank, and praise the LORD God of Israel.  
Asaph was the chief, and next to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obededom; Jeiel played the psaltery and harp, while Asaph made music with cymbals.  
Benaiah and Jahaziel, the priests, played trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.  
On that day, David first delivered this psalm to thank the LORD into the hands of Asaph and his brethren.  
Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name, and make known His deeds among the people.  
Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him, and speak of all His wondrous works.  
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.  
Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.  
Remember His marvelous works that He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth.  
O you descendants of Israel, His servant, you children of Jacob, His chosen ones.  
He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.  
Always be mindful of His covenant, the word He commanded for a thousand generations.  
Even the covenant He made with Abraham and His oath to Isaac.  
He confirmed the same to Jacob as a law and to Israel as an everlasting covenant,  
Saying, "To you, I will give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance."  
When you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.  
When they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people,  
He allowed no man to do them wrong; indeed, He reproved kings for their sake,  
Saying, "Do not touch My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm."  
Sing to the LORD, all the earth; proclaim His salvation from day to day.  
Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all peoples.  
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is also to be feared above all gods.  
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.  
Glory and honor are in His presence; strength and gladness are in His place.  
Give to the LORD, you families of the peoples; give to the LORD glory and strength.  
Give to the LORD the glory due to His name; bring an offering and come before Him; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.  
Fear before Him, all the earth; the world shall be stable, it shall not be moved.  
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let men say among the nations, "The LORD reigns."  
Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; let the fields rejoice, and all that is in them.  
Then the trees of the forest shall sing out at the presence of the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth.  
O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His mercy endures forever.  
And say, "Save us, O God of our salvation, gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in Your praise."  
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD.  
So David left Asaph and his brethren there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister before the ark continually, as each day's work required.  
Obededom and their brethren, sixty-eight in total; Obededom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were appointed as porters.  
Zadok the priest and his fellow priests were before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon,  
To offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering continually, morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which He commanded Israel.  
With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen by name to give thanks to the LORD, for His mercy endures forever.  
Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets and cymbals for those who were to make a sound, along with musical instruments of God. The sons of Jeduthun were porters.  
And all the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his own house.
