All of Israel was counted by genealogies; behold, they were recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were taken to Babylon due to their transgressions.  
The first inhabitants who settled in their possessions in their cities were the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.  
In Jerusalem lived some of the children of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh;  
Uthai, the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, from the children of Pharez, the son of Judah.  
From the Shilonites: Asaiah, the firstborn, and his sons.  
From the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brethren, numbering six hundred and ninety.  
From the sons of Benjamin: Sallu, the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,  
And Ibneiah, the son of Jeroham, Elah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam, the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;  
And their brethren, according to their generations, numbered nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were leaders of their families.  
Among the priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, and Jachin,  
And Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;  
And Adaiah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai, the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;  
And their brethren, heads of their families, numbered one thousand seven hundred and sixty; very capable men for the service of the house of God.  
Among the Levites were Shemaiah, the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, from the sons of Merari;  
And Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah, the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;  
And Obadiah, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah, the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.  
The porters were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;  
They had been stationed at the king's gate eastward: they served as porters in the companies of the children of Levi.  
Shallum, the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, from the house of his father, the Korahites, were responsible for the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: their ancestors, overseeing the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.  
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, had been their ruler in the past, and the LORD was with him.  
Zechariah, the son of Meshelemiah, was the porter at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
All those chosen to be porters at the gates numbered two hundred and twelve. They were counted by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer appointed in their designated roles.  
Thus, they and their children had oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, specifically the house of the tabernacle, by wards.  
The porters were stationed in four quarters, toward the east, west, north, and south.  
Their brethren, who lived in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time to assist them.  
These Levites, the four chief porters, held their designated positions and were responsible for the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.  
They lodged around the house of God, as the responsibility was upon them, and they were in charge of opening it every morning.  
Certain individuals were responsible for the ministering vessels, ensuring they were brought in and out as needed.  
Some were also appointed to oversee the vessels, all the instruments of the sanctuary, as well as the fine flour, wine, oil, frankincense, and spices.  
Some of the sons of the priests prepared the ointment of the spices.  
Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the designated role over the items made in the pans.  
Others from the sons of the Kohathites were responsible for the showbread, preparing it every Sabbath.  
These are the singers, leaders of the Levite families, who remained in the chambers and were free, as they were engaged in that work day and night.  
These chief fathers of the Levites were leaders throughout their generations; they lived in Jerusalem.  
In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:  
His firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, and Nadab.  
Also Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.  
Mikloth begat Shimeam. They also lived with their brethren in Jerusalem, opposite their brethren.  
Ner begat Kish; Kish begat Saul; Saul begat Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.  
The son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; Meribbaal begat Micah.  
The sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.  
Ahaz begat Jarah; Jarah begat Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; Zimri begat Moza;  
Moza begat Binea; Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son.  
Azel had six sons, whose names were Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
