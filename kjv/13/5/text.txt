Now, the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; however, because he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, the son of Israel, and the genealogy is not to be counted according to the birthright).
For Judah prevailed over his brothers, and from him came the chief ruler; but the birthright belonged to Joseph.
The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
The sons of Joel were Shemaiah, his son; Gog, his son; Shimei, his son;
Micah, his son; Reaia, his son; Baal, his son;
Beerah, his son, whom Tilgath-Pilneser, king of Assyria, carried away captive; he was a prince of the Reubenites.
And his brothers, by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was recorded, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah.
And Bela, the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer, extending to Nebo and Baalmeon.
Eastward, he inhabited the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their cattle multiplied in the land of Gilead.
In the days of Saul, they waged war against the Hagarites, who fell by their hand; they dwelt in their tents throughout all the eastern land of Gilead.
The children of Gad lived opposite them, in the land of Bashan, up to Salcah:
Joel was the chief, and Shapham the next, along with Jaanai and Shaphat in Bashan.
Their brothers from the house of their fathers were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Heber, seven in total.
These are the children of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;
Ahi, the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was the chief of the house of their fathers.
They dwelt in Gilead, in Bashan, in their towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, along their borders.
All these were recorded by genealogies in the days of Jotham, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, king of Israel.
The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, valiant men, able to bear buckler and sword, skilled in shooting with a bow and in warfare, numbered forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, who went out to battle.
They waged war against the Hagarites, along with Jetur, Nephish, and Nodab.
They were aided against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hands, along with all who were with them; for they cried out to God in battle, and He was entreated by them because they placed their trust in Him.
They took away their cattle: fifty thousand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, two thousand donkeys, and one hundred thousand men.
Many fell slain because the war was of God. They dwelt in their places until the captivity.
The children of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land; they increased from Bashan to Baal-Hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon.
These were the heads of the house of their fathers: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, renowned men, and heads of their families.
They transgressed against the God of their fathers and went astray after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser, king of Assyria, who carried them away, even the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river Gozan, where they remain to this day.
