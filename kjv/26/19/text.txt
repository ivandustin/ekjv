Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  
And say, What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, and she nourished her cubs among young lions.  
And she raised one of her cubs: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch prey; it devoured men.  
The nations also heard of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.  
Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.  
And he roamed among the lions, he became a young lion, learned to catch prey, and devoured men.  
And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; the land was desolate, and its fullness was gone, due to the noise of his roaring.  
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him: he was caught in their pit.  
And they put him in confinement with chains and brought him to the king of Babylon: they took him into holds, so that his voice would no longer be heard upon the mountains of Israel.  
Your mother is like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.  
And she had strong rods for the scepters of those who ruled, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches; she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.  
But she was uprooted in fury, cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.  
And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.  
And fire has gone out from a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
