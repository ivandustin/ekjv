The word of the LORD came to me once more, saying,  
"Son of man, speak to the prince of Tyrus, and declare, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Because your heart is lifted up, and you have claimed, "I am a God; I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas," yet you are merely a man and not God, despite setting your heart as if it were the heart of God.  
Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret can be hidden from you.  
With your wisdom and understanding, you have amassed wealth, gathering gold and silver into your treasures.  
Through your great wisdom and trade, you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your wealth.  
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,  
Behold, I will bring strangers upon you, the most fearsome of the nations; they will draw their swords against the splendor of your wisdom and defile your brilliance.  
They will bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of those slain in the midst of the seas.  
Will you still say before the one who slays you, "I am God"? But you shall be a man, not a God, in the hands of the one who slays you.  
You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers, for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.  
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyrus, and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.  
You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: sardius, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold; the craftsmanship of your tambourines and pipes was prepared in you on the day you were created.  
You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.  
You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you.  
Through the abundance of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned; therefore, I will cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God, and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.  
Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I will cast you to the ground; I will lay you before kings, that they may see you.  
You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trade; therefore, I will bring forth a fire from within you, and it shall consume you, and I will bring you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you.  
All who know you among the peoples will be appalled at you; you shall become a terror, and you shall never be anymore.'  
Again, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Son of man, set your face against Zidon and prophesy against it,  
And say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Zidon; I will be glorified in your midst, and they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her and am sanctified in her.  
For I will send a plague upon her and blood into her streets; the wounded shall be judged in her midst by the sword on every side, and they shall know that I am the LORD.  
And there shall no longer be a pricking brier for the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn from all those around them who despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  
Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the nations among which they are scattered and am sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.  
And they shall dwell safely there, build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they shall dwell securely when I execute judgments upon all those who despise them around them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God."
