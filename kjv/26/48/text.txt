The oblation that you shall offer to the LORD shall be of twenty-five thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.
And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north twenty-five thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.
It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; who have kept my charge, and who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be to them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
And opposite the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy to the LORD.
And the five thousand that are left in the breadth opposite the twenty-five thousand shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.

And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
And the residue in length opposite the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be opposite the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food to those who serve the city.
And those who serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
All the oblation shall be twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: you shall offer the holy oblation square, with the possession of the city.
And the residue shall be for the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, opposite the twenty-five thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward opposite the twenty-five thousand toward the west border, opposite the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
Moreover, from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
