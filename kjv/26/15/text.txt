And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"Son of man, what is the vine tree compared to any other tree, or to a branch among the trees of the forest?
Can wood be taken from it to do any work? Or will men take a pin from it to hang any vessel?
Look, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire consumes both ends, and the middle is burned. Is it suitable for any work?
Indeed, when it was whole, it was not suitable for any work; how much less will it be suitable for any work now that the fire has consumed it and it is burned?
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
I will set my face against them; they shall escape from one fire, but another fire shall consume them; and you shall know that I am the LORD when I set my face against them.
I will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord GOD."
