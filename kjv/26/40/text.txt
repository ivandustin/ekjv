In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck, on that very day the hand of the LORD came upon me and brought me there.  
In the visions of God, He brought me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, which appeared to be the frame of a city on the south side.  
He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance resembled that of brass, holding a line of flax and a measuring reed in his hand; he stood at the gate.  
The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for I am bringing you here to show you these things: declare all that you see to the house of Israel."  
And behold, there was a wall surrounding the house, and in the man's hand was a measuring reed of six cubits long, measured by the cubit and a handbreadth: he measured the width of the building as one reed, and the height as one reed.  
Then he approached the gate that faced east, ascended its stairs, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed wide; and the other threshold of the gate was also one reed wide.  
Each little chamber was one reed long and one reed wide; between the little chambers were five cubits, and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.  
He also measured the porch of the gate within, which was one reed.  
Then he measured the porch of the gate, which was eight cubits long, with the posts being two cubits wide; the porch of the gate was inward.  
The little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side and three on that side; they were all of the same measure: the posts had the same measure on both sides.  
He measured the width of the entry of the gate as ten cubits, and the length of the gate as thirteen cubits.  
The space before the little chambers was one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side; the little chambers were six cubits on each side.  
He measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the width was twenty-five cubits, door against door.  
He also made posts of sixty cubits, extending to the post of the court surrounding the gate.  
From the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.  
There were narrow windows in the little chambers and in their posts around the gate, as well as in the arches: windows were all around inward, and on each post were palm trees.  
Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around: thirty chambers were on the pavement.  
The pavement beside the gates opposite the length of the gates was the lower pavement.  
Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits eastward and northward.  
He measured the gate of the outer court that faced north, noting its length and width.  
The little chambers were three on this side and three on that side; the posts and arches were measured like those of the first gate: the length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty-five cubits.  
Their windows, arches, and palm trees were measured like those of the gate facing east; they ascended to it by seven steps, and the arches were before them.  
The gate of the inner court was opposite the gate toward the north and the east; he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.  
After that, he brought me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south: he measured its posts and arches according to these measures.  
There were windows in it and in its arches all around, similar to those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty-five cubits.  
There were seven steps leading up to it, and the arches were before them; it had palm trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon its posts.  
There was a gate in the inner court toward the south: he measured from gate to gate toward the south one hundred cubits.  
He brought me to the inner court by the south gate and measured the south gate according to these measures;  
The little chambers, posts, and arches were measured according to these specifications: there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.  
The arches around it were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.  
The arches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on the posts; the ascent to it had eight steps.  
He brought me into the inner court toward the east and measured the gate according to these measures.  
The little chambers, posts, and arches were measured according to these specifications: there were windows in them and in their arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.  
The arches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on the posts, on both sides; the ascent to it had eight steps.  
He brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these specifications;  
The little chambers, posts, arches, and windows around it were measured: the length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty-five cubits.  
The posts faced the outer court, and palm trees were on the posts, on both sides; the ascent to it had eight steps.  
The chambers and their entries were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.  
In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, for slaying the burnt offering, sin offering, and trespass offering.  
At the side outside, as one ascends to the entry of the north gate, there were two tables; and on the other side, at the porch of the gate, were two tables.  
Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, beside the gate; eight tables where they slaughtered their sacrifices.  
The four tables were made of hewn stone for the burnt offering, each one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one cubit high: upon them, they laid the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offering and the sacrifice.  
Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.  
Outside the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, located at the side of the north gate; their view was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate had a view toward the north.  
He said to me, "This chamber, which faces south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house."  
The chamber that faces north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who draw near to the LORD to minister to Him.  
So he measured the court, which was one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square; and the altar that was before the house.  
He brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch: five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; the width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.  
The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width was eleven cubits; he brought me by the steps leading up to it: there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.
