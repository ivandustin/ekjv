The word of the LORD came to me once more, saying,
"Son of man, direct your gaze toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them;
And tell the Ammonites, 'Listen to the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD: Because you exclaimed, "Aha," against my sanctuary when it was desecrated, and against the land of Israel when it lay in ruins, and against the house of Judah when they were taken captive;
Therefore, I will hand you over to the men of the east as a possession; they will establish their palaces within you and make their homes among you. They will consume your produce and drink your milk.
I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and the Ammonites into a resting place for flocks; then you will know that I am the LORD.
For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you clapped your hands, stomped your feet, and rejoiced in your heart with all your contempt against the land of Israel;
Therefore, I will stretch out my hand against you and deliver you as plunder to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples and cause you to perish from the lands; I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab and Seir say, "Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations;"
Therefore, behold, I will open the flank of Moab, from its cities, from its cities on the borders, the glory of the land, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,
To the men of the east along with the Ammonites, and I will give them as a possession, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.
I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD.
Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by seeking revenge, and has greatly offended and avenged itself upon them;
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and I will cut off both man and beast from it; I will make it desolate from Teman, and those of Dedan will fall by the sword.
I will carry out my vengeance upon Edom through my people Israel; they will act in Edom according to my anger and my fury, and they will know my vengeance, says the Lord GOD.
Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines have acted out of revenge and taken vengeance with a spiteful heart, seeking to destroy out of ancient hatred;
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the coastal region.
I will carry out great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I execute my vengeance upon them."
