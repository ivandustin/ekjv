You, son of man, take a tile and place it before you, and draw the city, even Jerusalem, on it.
Lay siege to it, build a fort against it, and cast a mound against it; set up a camp around it and place battering rams against it.
Furthermore, take an iron pan and set it as a wall of iron between you and the city; set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege to it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
Lie on your left side and bear the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of days you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.
For I have assigned to you the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus, you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
When you have completed these days, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah for forty days; I have appointed you a day for each year.
Therefore, set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and let your arm be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.
Behold, I will bind you, and you shall not turn from one side to another until you have completed the days of your siege.
Also, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel; make bread from them according to the number of days you lie on your sideâ€”three hundred and ninety days you shall eat from it.
Your food shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; you shall eat it from time to time.
You shall also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; you shall drink it from time to time.
You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it with human dung in their sight.
And the LORD said, "Even so shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, wherever I drive them."
Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth even until now, I have not eaten anything that died of itself or was torn by beasts; nor has any abominable flesh come into my mouth."
Then He said to me, "Look, I have given you cow's dung instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread with it."
Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment.
They will lack bread and water, and they will be appalled with one another and waste away because of their iniquity."
