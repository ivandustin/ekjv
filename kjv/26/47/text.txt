Afterward, he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house faced east. The waters descended from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

Then he led me out through the gate northward and guided me around to the outer gate that looked eastward; and behold, waters flowed out on the right side.

When the man with the measuring line went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits and brought me through the waters, which were up to my ankles.

He measured another thousand cubits and brought me through the waters, which were up to my knees. He measured yet another thousand and brought me through; the waters were up to my loins.

Afterward, he measured a thousand more; and it was a river that I could not cross, for the waters had risen, waters deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.

He asked me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river.

Upon my return, I noticed that on both sides of the river there were many trees.

He said to me, "These waters flow toward the eastern region, going down into the desert and into the sea; when they reach the sea, the waters will be healed."

It shall come to pass that every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, shall live; there will be a very great multitude of fish, for these waters will flow there, and they will be healed; everything will live wherever the river goes.

It shall come to pass that fishermen will stand by it from Engedi to Eneglaim; they will spread their nets there, and their catch will be of various kinds, like the fish of the great sea, exceedingly numerous.

However, the marshy places and the swamps will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.

On both banks of the river, all kinds of trees will grow for food, whose leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not be consumed. They will bear new fruit every month, because their waters flow from the sanctuary; their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.

Thus says the Lord GOD: "This shall be the border by which you will inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions."

You shall inherit it equally, just as I swore to give it to your ancestors; this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.

This shall be the border of the land on the north side, from the Great Sea along the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad;

Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.

The border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the northward border of Hamath. This is the north side.

On the east side, you shall measure from Hauran, from Damascus, from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by the Jordan, from the border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.

The south side shall extend from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the Great Sea. This is the south side.

The west side shall be the Great Sea from the border until one comes opposite Hamath. This is the west side.

You shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.

It shall come to pass that you will divide it by lot for an inheritance for yourselves and for the strangers who sojourn among you, who will have children among you; they shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel, and they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

It shall come to pass that in whatever tribe the stranger resides, there you shall give him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD.
