He cried out loudly in my ears, saying, "Bring near those who have charge over the city, every man with his destructive weapon in hand."  
And behold, six men approached from the direction of the higher gate, which faces north, each man armed with a slaughter weapon; among them was one man dressed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his side. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.  
The glory of the God of Israel had ascended from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the house. He called to the man dressed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn at his side.  
The LORD instructed him, "Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and place a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry for all the abominations committed within it."  
To the others, he said in my hearing, "Follow him through the city and strike; do not let your eye spare, nor have pity."  
"Completely slay old and young, both maidens and little children, and women; but do not approach any man who has the mark; begin at my sanctuary." So they started with the elders who were before the house.  
He instructed them, "Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain; go forth." They went out and killed in the city.  
As they were slaying them, I was left, and I fell on my face, crying out, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in your outpouring of fury upon Jerusalem?"  
He replied to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, the land is full of blood, and the city is full of perversity; for they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the earth, and the LORD does not see.'"  
"As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their deeds upon their own heads."  
And behold, the man dressed in linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
