Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Also, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end, the end has come upon the four corners of the land.
Now the end has come upon you, and I will send my anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and will recompense you for all your abominations.
And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; I will recompense your ways upon you, and your abominations shall be in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Thus says the Lord GOD: An evil, an only evil, behold, it has come.
An end has come, the end has come; it watches for you; behold, it is here.
The morning has come upon you, O you who dwell in the land; the time has come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.
Now I will shortly pour out my fury upon you and accomplish my anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and will recompense you for all your abominations.
And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD who strikes.
Behold the day, behold, it has come; the morning has gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.
Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs; neither shall there be wailing for them.
The time has come, the day draws near; let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
They have blown the trumpet to make all ready, but none goes to battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
The sword is without, and pestilence and famine are within; he who is in the field shall die by the sword, and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
But those who escape shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.
All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, nor fill their bowels, for it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein; therefore, I have set it far from them.
And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
My face will I also turn from them, and they shall pollute my secret place; for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it.
Make a chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
Therefore, I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses; I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease, and their holy places shall be defiled.
Destruction comes, and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then they shall seek a vision of the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled; I will do to them according to their ways, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
