And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD and sat before me.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you here to inquire of me? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Make them aware of the abominations of their fathers.
And say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day I chose Israel and lifted my hand to the descendants of the house of Jacob, I made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
On the day I lifted my hand to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land I had spied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:
Then I said to them, Cast away every man the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
But I acted for my name's sake, so that it would not be polluted before the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
Therefore, I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
And I gave them my statutes and showed them my judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them.
Moreover, I also gave them my sabbaths as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not walk in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted. Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them.
But I acted for my name's sake, so that it would not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
Yet I also lifted my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
Because they despised my judgments, did not walk in my statutes, and polluted my sabbaths; for their hearts went after their idols.
Nevertheless, my eye spared them from destroying them, nor did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
But I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, keep my judgments, and do them;
And hallow my sabbaths; they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, nor kept my judgments to do them, which if a man does, he shall live by them; they polluted my sabbaths. Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Nevertheless, I withdrew my hand and acted for my name's sake, so that it would not be polluted in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
I lifted my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries;
Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
Therefore, I gave them statutes that were not good and judgments by which they could not live;
And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, so that they might know that I am the LORD.
Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Yet in this, your fathers have blasphemed me by committing a trespass against me.
For when I had brought them into the land for which I lifted my hand to give it to them, they saw every high hill and all the thick trees, and they offered their sacrifices there, and presented the provocation of their offerings: there also they made their sweet savor and poured out their drink offerings.
Then I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? And the name of it is called Bamah to this day.
Therefore, say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you polluted after the manner of your fathers? And do you commit whoredom after their abominations?
For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be like the nations, like the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.
Just as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, says the Lord GOD.
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
And I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the LORD.
As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go, serve every one of you his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols.
For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
I will accept you with your sweet savor when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.
And you shall know that I am the LORD when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I lifted my hand to give it to your fathers.
And there you shall remember your ways and all your doings in which you have been defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.
And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have acted with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
And all flesh shall see that I, the LORD, have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
Then I said, Ah Lord GOD! They say of me, Does he not speak in parables?
