Then he led me out to the outer court, toward the north, and brought me to the chamber opposite the separate place, which was in front of the building to the north.
In front of the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and its width was fifty cubits.
Opposite the twenty cubits designated for the inner court, and opposite the pavement for the outer court, there was a gallery facing another gallery in three stories.
In front of the chambers was a walkway ten cubits wide, leading inward, with a passageway of one cubit; their doors faced north.
The upper chambers were shorter because the galleries were higher than those of the lower and middle sections of the building.
They were arranged in three stories but lacked the pillars found in the courts; thus, the building was narrower than the lower and middle sections from the ground.
The outer wall opposite the chambers, facing the outer court at the front of the chambers, measured fifty cubits in length.
The length of the chambers in the outer court was fifty cubits, and behold, in front of the temple was a hundred cubits.
The entry to these chambers was on the east side, accessible from the outer court.
The chambers were built into the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate place and the building.
The pathway in front of them resembled the appearance of the chambers to the north, being as long and as wide as they were; all their exits were according to their designs and their doors.
According to the doors of the chambers facing south, there was a door at the head of the pathway, directly in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, are holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall place the most holy items, including the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; for this place is holy."
When the priests enter there, they shall not leave the holy place to go into the outer court; instead, they shall lay aside their ministerial garments, for they are holy, and shall put on other garments to approach those things meant for the people.
After he finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out toward the gate that faces east and measured it all around.
He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, all around.
He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, all around with the measuring reed.
He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
He measured it on all four sides: it had a wall all around, five hundred reeds long and five hundred reeds wide, to create a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
