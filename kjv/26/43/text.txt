Afterward, he led me to the gate that faces the east.
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the east; His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory.
It was in accordance with the vision I had seen, the same vision I had when I came to destroy the city; the visions were similar to what I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.
The glory of the LORD entered the house through the gate that faces the east.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
I heard Him speaking to me from within the house, and the man stood beside me.
He said to me, "Son of man, the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever, and My holy name, the house of Israel shall no longer defile, neither they nor their kings, by their unfaithfulness, nor by the corpses of their kings in their high places.
By setting their threshold next to My thresholds, and their posts next to My posts, and the wall between Me and them, they have defiled My holy name by their abominations; therefore, I have consumed them in My anger.
Now let them remove their unfaithfulness and the corpses of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell among them forever.
Son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
If they are ashamed of all they have done, show them the form of the house, its design, its exits, its entrances, all its forms, all its ordinances, and all its laws; write it in their sight, that they may keep the entire design and all its ordinances and do them.
This is the law of the house: on the top of the mountain, the entire area around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
These are the measurements of the altar according to the cubits: the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth; the base shall be a cubit, the width a cubit, and the border around it shall be a span; this shall be the higher place of the altar.
From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width one cubit.
Thus, the altar shall be four cubits high, and from the altar upward shall be four horns.
The altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve cubits wide, square in its four corners.
The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide in its four corners; the border around it shall be half a cubit, and the base shall be a cubit all around; its steps shall face the east.
He said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances of the altar on the day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it.
You shall give to the priests, the Levites of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me, says the Lord GOD, a young bull for a sin offering.
You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and around the border; thus, you shall cleanse and purify it.
You shall take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
On the second day, you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; they shall cleanse the altar as they did with the bull.
When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish.
You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
For seven days, you shall prepare a goat for a sin offering each day; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock without blemish.
For seven days, they shall cleanse the altar and purify it; they shall consecrate themselves.
And when these days are over, on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD.
