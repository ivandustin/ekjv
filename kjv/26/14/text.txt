Then certain elders of Israel approached me and sat down in my presence.  
And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and placed the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I be consulted by them at all?  
Therefore, speak to them and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart and places the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I, the LORD, will answer him according to the multitude of his idols.  
That I may take the house of Israel in their own hearts, for they are all estranged from me through their idols.  
Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols; turn your faces away from all your abominations.'  
For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who sojourns in Israel, who separates himself from me, sets up his idols in his heart, and places the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I, the LORD, will answer him myself.  
And I will set my face against that man, make him a sign and a proverb, and cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD.  
And if the prophet is deceived when he speaks a thing, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet; I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.  
And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who seeks him.  
That the house of Israel may no longer stray from me, nor be polluted with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD.  
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,  
"Son of man, when the land sins against me by committing grievous trespasses, then I will stretch out my hand against it, break the staff of its bread, send famine upon it, and cut off man and beast from it.  
Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD.  
If I cause destructive beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it, making it desolate so that no man may pass through because of the beasts,  
Even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.  
Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, 'Sword, go through the land,' cutting off man and beast from it,  
Even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be delivered.  
Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood, cutting off man and beast from it,  
Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would only deliver their own souls by their righteousness.  
For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem—the sword, famine, destructive beasts, and pestilence—to cut off man and beast from it?  
Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant that will be brought forth, both sons and daughters; behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their ways and their doings; and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.  
And they shall comfort you when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have not acted without cause in all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD.
