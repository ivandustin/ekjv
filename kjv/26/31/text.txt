And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
"Son of man, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his multitude; whom are you like in your greatness?
Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and a shadowing canopy, and of a high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
The waters made him great; the deep set him up on high with her rivers running around his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.
Therefore, his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the abundance of waters when he shot forth.
All the birds of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches, all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
Thus, he was beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his branches; for his root was by great waters.
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like him in his beauty.
I made him beautiful by the multitude of his branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have lifted yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off and left him; upon the mountains and in all the valleys, his branches have fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have left him.
Upon his ruin shall all the birds of the heavens remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, nor stand tall in their height, all that drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.
Thus says the Lord GOD: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused mourning; I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
I made the nations shake at the sound of his fall when I cast him down to hell with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
They also went down to hell with him, to those who are slain with the sword; and they who were his arm, who dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.
