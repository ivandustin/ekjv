Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be closed during the six working days; but on the Sabbath, it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon, it shall also be opened.  
The prince shall enter through the porch of that gate from the outside and shall stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Afterward, he shall go out, but the gate shall remain open until evening.  
Similarly, the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and during the new moons.  
The burnt offering that the prince shall present to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall consist of six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram.  
The grain offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs, he shall provide as much as he is able, along with an hin of oil for each ephah.  
On the day of the new moon, he shall offer a young bull without blemish, along with six lambs and a ram, all without blemish.  
He shall prepare a grain offering, an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according to his ability, along with an hin of oil for each ephah.  
When the prince enters, he shall go in through the porch of that gate and shall exit by the same way.  
However, when the people of the land come before the LORD during the solemn feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall exit by the south gate; and he who enters by the south gate shall exit by the north gate. He shall not return by the same gate through which he entered, but shall go out directly opposite it.  
The prince, in their midst, shall enter when they enter, and shall exit when they exit.  
During the feasts and solemnities, the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to provide, along with an hin of oil for each ephah.  
When the prince prepares a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings to the LORD, the gate that faces east shall be opened for him, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. After he goes out, the gate shall be shut.  
You shall prepare a daily burnt offering to the LORD of a one-year-old lamb without blemish; you shall prepare it every morning.  
You shall also prepare a grain offering for it every morning, consisting of the sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to mix with the fine flour; this shall be a continual grain offering as a perpetual ordinance to the LORD.  
Thus shall they prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering.  
Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall be their possession by inheritance.  
But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall belong to him until the year of jubilee; afterward, it shall return to the prince, but his inheritance shall remain with his sons.  
Moreover, the prince shall not take from the people's inheritance by oppression, to displace them from their possessions; rather, he shall give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions, so that my people are not scattered, each man from his possession.  
After he brought me through the entry at the side of the gate into the holy chambers of the priests, which faced north, I saw a place on both sides toward the west.  
Then he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not carry them out into the outer court to sanctify the people."  
He then brought me into the outer court and made me pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court, there was a court.  
In the four corners of the court, there were courts joined together, each measuring forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; these four corners were of the same measure.  
There was a row of buildings all around them, four in total, with boiling places beneath the rows all around.  
Then he said to me, "These are the places for those who boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
