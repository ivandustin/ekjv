And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Son of man, present a riddle and share a parable with the house of Israel;  
And say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with large wings, long feathers, and various colors came to Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar.  
He trimmed off the top of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade; he planted it in a city of merchants.  
He also took some of the seed from the land and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by abundant waters and set it like a willow tree.  
And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him: thus it became a vine, producing branches and shooting forth sprigs.  
There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him, so that he might water it in the furrows of its planting.  
It was planted in good soil by abundant waters, so that it might produce branches and bear fruit, becoming a goodly vine.  
Say this: 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it prosper? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit so that it withers? It shall wither in all the leaves of its spring, even without great power or many people to uproot it.  
Yes, behold, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the furrows where it grew.  
Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things mean? Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem, taken its king and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;  
And he has taken some of the king's seed, made a covenant with him, and taken an oath from him; he has also taken the mighty of the land,  
So that the kingdom might be humble, not lifting itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.  
But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt to obtain horses and a large army. Will he prosper? Will he escape who does such things? Or will he break the covenant and be delivered?  
As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells, who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, even there in the midst of Babylon he shall die.  
Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in war, by casting up mounds and building forts to cut off many people.  
Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when he had given his hand and done all these things, he shall not escape.  
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken, I will bring upon his own head.  
And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylon and plead with him there for his transgression against me.  
And all his fugitives with all their bands shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to all winds: and you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken it.  
Thus says the Lord GOD: I will also take from the highest branch of the high cedar and set it; I will trim off a tender one from the top of its young twigs and plant it on a high and prominent mountain.  
On the mountain height of Israel, I will plant it; it shall bring forth boughs, bear fruit, and become a goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches, they shall dwell.  
And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the LORD, have brought down the high tree, exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree flourish: I, the LORD, have spoken and done it."
