Afterward, he brought me to the temple and measured the posts, which were six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side, the same width as the tabernacle.  
The width of the door was ten cubits, with five cubits on each side; he measured its length at forty cubits and its width at twenty cubits.  
Then he went inside and measured the door post, which was two cubits wide, and the door itself, which was six cubits wide, with a total width of seven cubits for the door.  
He measured the length of the inner space at twenty cubits and the width at twenty cubits before the temple, saying to me, "This is the most holy place."  
After measuring the wall of the house, he found it to be six cubits thick, and the width of each side chamber was four cubits, surrounding the house on every side.  
The side chambers were three stories high, arranged in thirty rows; they were built into the wall of the house to provide support, but they did not extend into the wall itself.  
There was an expansion and a winding upward to the side chambers, as the structure continued to rise; thus, the width of the house increased from the lowest chamber to the highest.  
I also observed the height of the house all around: the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six cubits.  
The thickness of the outer wall for the side chambers was five cubits, leaving space for the side chambers within.  
Between the chambers, there was a width of twenty cubits surrounding the house on every side.  
The doors of the side chambers faced the remaining space, with one door to the north and another to the south; the width of the remaining space was five cubits all around.  
The building in front of the separate place at the western end measured seventy cubits wide, with walls five cubits thick all around, and a length of ninety cubits.  
He measured the house, which was one hundred cubits long, including the separate place and the building with its walls, also measuring one hundred cubits.  
The width of the front of the house and the separate place toward the east was one hundred cubits.  
He measured the length of the building opposite the separate place behind it, including the galleries on both sides, which measured one hundred cubits, along with the inner temple and the porches of the court.  
The door posts, narrow windows, and galleries surrounding the three stories faced the door, all paneled with wood from the ground up to the windows, which were also covered.  
This extended above the door, into the inner house, and around all the walls both inside and out, measured precisely.  
It was adorned with cherubim and palm trees, with a palm tree positioned between each cherub; each cherub had two faces.  
The face of a man looked toward the palm tree on one side, while the face of a young lion looked toward the palm tree on the other side; this design was consistent throughout the house.  
From the ground up to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were depicted on the walls of the temple.  
The posts of the temple were square, and the appearance of the sanctuary was consistent with that of the posts.  
The wooden altar was three cubits high and two cubits long, with its corners, length, and walls made of wood; he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."  
The temple and the sanctuary each had two doors.  
Each door had two leaves, with two turning leaves; there were two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other door.  
On the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees were carved, similar to those on the walls, and there were thick planks on the outer face of the porch.  
There were narrow windows and palm trees on both sides of the porch, as well as on the side chambers of the house, with thick planks.
