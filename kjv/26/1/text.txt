In the thirtieth year, during the fourth month and on the fifth day, while I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens opened, and I witnessed visions of God.
On the fifth day of the month, which marked the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity,
the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was upon him.
I looked, and behold, a whirlwind emerged from the north, a great cloud with fire engulfing itself, and a brightness surrounded it, with the appearance of amber from the midst of the fire.
From the midst of it appeared four living creatures, and this was their appearance: they resembled a man.
Each had four faces and four wings.
Their feet were straight, and the soles of their feet resembled those of a calf, sparkling like burnished brass.
They had human hands under their wings on all four sides; each of them had faces and wings.
Their wings were connected to one another; they did not turn as they moved; each went straight ahead.
Regarding the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle.
Such were their faces; their wings were stretched upward; two wings of each were joined together, and two covered their bodies.
They moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit directed them, they went, and they did not turn as they moved.
The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire, resembling lamps; they moved up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, with lightning flashing from it.
The living creatures ran and returned like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
As I observed the living creatures, I noticed a wheel on the earth beside them, with four faces.
The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the color of beryl; they all had the same likeness, and their appearance and construction were like a wheel within a wheel.
When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning.
Their rims were so high that they were awe-inspiring, and they were full of eyes all around.
When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved alongside them; when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels also rose.
Wherever the spirit directed them to go, they went; the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
When those moved, these moved; when those stood still, these stood still; when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of terrible crystal, stretched out over their heads.
Under the firmament, their wings were straight, one toward the other; each had two wings covering one side and two covering the other side of their bodies.
When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the sound of an army; when they stood still, they lowered their wings.
A voice came from the firmament above their heads when they stood and lowered their wings.
Above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, resembling a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the appearance of a man.
I saw the color of amber, with the appearance of fire all around within it, from the appearance of his loins upward, and from the appearance of his loins downward, I saw the appearance of fire, with brightness all around.
Like the appearance of a rainbow in the cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell on my face and heard the voice of one speaking.
