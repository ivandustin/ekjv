And he said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you."  
The spirit entered me as he spoke, and set me on my feet, so that I could hear him speaking to me.  
He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has turned against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against me even to this very day."  
For they are obstinate children and hard-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'  
And whether they listen or refuse to listen (for they are a rebellious house), they will know that a prophet has been among them.  
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though thorns and thistles are with you, and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed by their looks, even though they are a rebellious house.  
You shall speak my words to them, whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are very rebellious.  
But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.  
And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent to me, and there was a scroll of a book in it;  
He spread it before me, and it was written on both sides; there were lamentations, mourning, and woe written on it.
