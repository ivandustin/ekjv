Then Jacob set out on his journey and arrived in the land of the eastern people.
He looked and saw a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep lying beside it; for the flocks were watered from that well, and a large stone covered the mouth of the well.
All the flocks were gathered there; they rolled the stone away from the well's mouth, watered the sheep, and then replaced the stone on the well's mouth.
Jacob asked them, "My brothers, where are you from?" They replied, "We are from Haran."
He inquired, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?" They answered, "We know him."
He asked, "Is he well?" They responded, "He is well, and look, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep."
Jacob said, "It is still broad daylight; it is not the time for the cattle to be gathered. Water the sheep and let them graze."
They replied, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was the shepherdess.
When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, he approached, rolled the stone away from the well's mouth, and watered Laban's flock.
Jacob kissed Rachel, raised his voice, and wept.
He told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebekah's son; she ran and told her father.
When Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob shared all that had happened.
Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." Jacob stayed with him for a month.
Laban then said to Jacob, "Since you are my brother, should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.
Jacob loved Rachel and said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter, Rachel."
Laban replied, "It is better that I give her to you than to another man; stay with me."
Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him like just a few days because of his love for her.
Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."
Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.
In the evening, he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to Jacob; he went in to her.
Laban gave his daughter Leah Zilpah, his maid, to be her handmaid.
In the morning, behold, it was Leah! Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
Laban replied, "It is not our custom to give the younger before the firstborn.
Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service you will give me for another seven years."
Jacob agreed and completed the week; then Laban gave him Rachel, his daughter, as a wife as well.
Laban also gave Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
Jacob went in to Rachel as well, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served Laban for another seven years.
When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben, saying, "Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; now my husband will love me."
She conceived again and bore a son, saying, "Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son also." She named him Simeon.
She conceived again and bore a son, saying, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore, he was named Levi.
She conceived again and bore a son, saying, "Now I will praise the LORD." Therefore, she named him Judah and ceased bearing.
