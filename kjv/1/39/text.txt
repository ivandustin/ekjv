Joseph was taken down to Egypt, where Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, an Egyptian, purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.  
The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man, residing in the house of his Egyptian master.  
His master noticed that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to succeed.  
Joseph found favor in his master's eyes and served him; Potiphar made him overseer of his house and entrusted everything he owned to Joseph.  
From the moment he appointed Joseph as overseer, the LORD blessed Potiphar's house for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, both in the house and in the field.  
Potiphar left everything he owned in Joseph's care; he did not concern himself with anything except for the food he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome.  
After some time, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Lie with me."  
But he refused, saying to her, "My master does not know what is in the house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care.  
There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"  
Despite her daily insistence, Joseph did not listen to her, choosing not to lie beside her or be with her.  
One day, Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household men were present.  
She grabbed him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" But he left his garment in her hand and ran away.  
When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled,  
she called to the men of her house and said, "Look, he has brought a Hebrew in here to mock us! He came in to lie with me, and I screamed loudly.  
When he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his garment with me and fled."  
She kept his garment with her until her husband came home.  
She then spoke to him with these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to mock me.  
But when I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment with me and fled."  
When Joseph's master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is how your servant treated me," his anger was aroused.  
Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, a place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he remained there.  
But the LORD was with Joseph, showing him mercy and granting him favor in the sight of the prison keeper.  
The prison keeper entrusted all the prisoners to Joseph's care, and whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.  
The prison keeper paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care because the LORD was with him, and whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.
