And it came to pass during the reign of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of nations;
These kings waged war against Bera, king of Sodom, Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, also known as Zoar.
All of them united in the vale of Siddim, which is near the salt sea.
For twelve years, they served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the allied kings attacked, defeating the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
And the Horites in their mountain Seir, as far as Elparan, which is near the wilderness.
They returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and struck down all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazezontamar.
Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (which is Zoar) went out to confront them in the vale of Siddim;
Against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, Tidal, king of nations, Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar; four kings against five.
The vale of Siddim was filled with slime pits; the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there, while the survivors escaped to the mountains.
They seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, along with their provisions, and departed.
They captured Lot, Abram's nephew, who lived in Sodom, along with his possessions, and left.
A survivor escaped and informed Abram the Hebrew, who lived in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner; these were allies of Abram.
When Abram learned that his relative had been taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his household, numbering three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them as far as Dan.
He divided his forces against them at night, striking them down and pursuing them to Hobah, which is on the left side of Damascus.
He recovered all the goods and brought back his nephew Lot, along with his possessions, the women, and the people.
The king of Sodom came out to meet him after his return from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was a priest of the Most High God.
He blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, creator of heaven and earth;
And blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself."
Abram replied to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand to the LORD, the Most High God, creator of heaven and earth,
That I will not take anything, not even a thread or a sandal strap, so that you cannot say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
Except for what the young men have eaten and the share of the men who went with meâ€”Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
