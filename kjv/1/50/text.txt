And Joseph fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
Joseph instructed his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father, and they did so for Israel.
The embalming process took forty days, as is customary, and the Egyptians mourned for him for seventy days.
After the mourning period, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's household, saying, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please convey this to Pharaoh:
My father made me swear an oath, saying, 'I am about to die; in the grave I have prepared for myself in Canaan, you shall bury me.' Therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will return."
Pharaoh replied, "Go up and bury your father, as you have sworn to do."
Joseph went to bury his father, accompanied by all Pharaoh's servants, the elders of his household, and all the elders of Egypt.
Along with them were Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's family; they left their little ones, flocks, and herds in the land of Goshen.
A great company accompanied him, including chariots and horsemen.
They arrived at the threshing floor of Atad, beyond the Jordan, where they mourned with a deep and sorrowful lamentation, mourning for his father for seven days.
When the Canaanites living in the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they remarked, "This is a serious mourning for the Egyptians," and thus it was named Abel-mizraim, beyond the Jordan.
Joseph's sons did as he had instructed them:
They carried him to Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham had purchased as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.
After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him.
When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they feared that Joseph might harbor resentment and repay them for the wrongs they had done to him.
They sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, "Your father instructed us before he died, saying,
'You shall say to Joseph, "I ask you to forgive the transgressions and sins of your brothers, for they did you wrong." Now, we ask you to forgive the transgressions of the servants of the God of your father.'" Joseph wept upon hearing their message.
His brothers also came and fell before him, saying, "We are your servants."
Joseph replied, "Do not be afraid; am I in the place of God?
You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
So do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your children." He comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
Joseph lived in Egypt, along with his father's household, and he lived to be one hundred and ten years old.
Joseph saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation; the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also raised on Joseph's knees.
Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely come to your aid and bring you up from this land to the land He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath, saying, "God will surely come to your aid, and you must carry my bones up from this place."
So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten, and they embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.
