In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was formless and empty; darkness covered the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God hovered over the waters.
And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
God called the light "Day," and the darkness He called "Night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, to separate the waters from the waters."
God made the firmament and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above it; and it was so.
God called the firmament "Heaven." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
And God said, "Let the waters under heaven be gathered together in one place, and let dry land appear." And it was so.
God called the dry land "Earth," and the gathering of the waters He called "Seas." And God saw that it was good.
And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit with seeds in them, according to their kinds." And it was so.
The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seeds in them, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to separate the day from the night; and let them serve as signs for seasons, days, and years."
Let them be lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so.
God made two great lights: the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night; He also made the stars.
God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the living creatures that have life, and birds that fly above the earth across the firmament of heaven."
God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth, each according to its kind." And it was so.
God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the livestock, and all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God, He created him; male and female, He created them.
God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves on the earth."
And God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree that bears fruit with seed in it; to you, it shall be for food."
And to every beast of the earth, every bird of the air, and everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food." And it was so.
God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
