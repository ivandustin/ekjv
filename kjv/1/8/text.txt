And God remembered Noah, along with every living creature and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; God sent a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.  
The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed, and the rain from heaven was restrained.  
The waters gradually receded from the earth, and after one hundred and fifty days, they had diminished.  
The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.  
The waters continued to decrease until the tenth month; on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.  
After forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made.  
He sent out a raven, which flew back and forth until the waters dried up from the earth.  
He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.  
But the dove found no place to rest her foot and returned to him in the ark, for the waters covered the entire earth; he reached out his hand, took her, and brought her back into the ark.  
He waited another seven days and again sent the dove out of the ark.  
The dove returned to him in the evening, and behold, she had an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.  
He waited another seven days and sent out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him.  
In the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth; Noah removed the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the ground was dry.  
In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was completely dry.  
God spoke to Noah, saying,  
"Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives with you.  
Bring out with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, including birds, cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth; let them multiply abundantly on the earth and be fruitful and multiply."  
Noah went out, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives.  
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, and whatever creeps on the earth, came out of the ark, each after its kind.  
Noah built an altar to the LORD; he took of every clean animal and every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  
The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living thing as I have done.  
As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease."
