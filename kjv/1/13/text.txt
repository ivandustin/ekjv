And Abram left Egypt with his wife, all his possessions, and Lot, heading into the southern region.  
Abram was very wealthy, possessing cattle, silver, and gold.  
He traveled from the south to Bethel, to the place where he had originally set up his tent, between Bethel and Ai.  
He returned to the site of the altar he had built earlier, and there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.  
Lot, who accompanied Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.  
The land could not support both of them living together, as their wealth was substantial, making cohabitation impossible.  
A conflict arose between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and those of Lot's cattle, while the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the land at that time.  
Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no conflict between us, or between our herdsmen, for we are brothers."  
"Is not the entire land before you? Please separate from me: if you go left, I will go right; or if you go right, I will go left."  
Lot looked up and saw the entire plain of Jordan, well-watered everywhere, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the LORD, comparable to the land of Egypt, as one approaches Zoar.  
Lot chose the entire plain of Jordan for himself and journeyed eastward, thus they parted ways.  
Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom.  
However, the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful in the eyes of the LORD.  
After Lot had separated from him, the LORD said to Abram, "Lift up your eyes and look from where you are, northward, southward, eastward, and westward.  
For all the land you see, I will give to you and your descendants forever.  
I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth; if anyone could count the dust, then your descendants could also be counted.  
Get up and walk through the land, its length and breadth, for I am giving it to you."  
Then Abram moved his tent and settled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built an altar there to the LORD.
