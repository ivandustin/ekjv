And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.  
When Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the region, saw her, he took her, lay with her, and violated her.  
His soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.  
Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this young woman as my wife."  
Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah; his sons were in the field with their livestock, and Jacob remained silent until they returned.  
Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to speak with Jacob.  
When Jacob's sons heard about it, they came in from the field; they were deeply grieved and very angry because Shechem had committed a disgraceful act in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, which should not be done.  
Hamor spoke to them, saying, "My son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him as a wife."  
"Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves."  
"You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you; settle and trade in it, and acquire property."  
Shechem said to her father and her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me, I will give."  
"Ask for as much dowry and gift as you like, and I will give you whatever you ask; just give me the young woman as my wife."  
The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, saying this because he had violated their sister Dinah.  
They said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.  
But we will agree to this on one condition: if you will become like us by having every male among you circumcised.  
Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.  
But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."  
Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.  
The young man did not delay in doing the thing because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter; he was more honorable than all the household of his father.  
Hamor and Shechem his son went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,  
"These men are peaceful toward us; therefore, let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for the land is spacious enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives and give them our daughters."  
"Only on this condition will the men agree to live with us and become one people: every male among us must be circumcised, just as they are."  
"Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us agree to their terms, and they will dwell with us."  
All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of the city.  
On the third day, when they were in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and boldly attacked the city, killing all the males.  
They killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.  
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city because they had violated their sister.  
They took their sheep, oxen, donkeys, and everything that was in the city and in the fields.  
They seized all their wealth, their little ones, and their wives, taking them captive and plundering everything that was in the houses.  
Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number; they will gather against me and attack me, and I will be destroyed, I and my household."  
They replied, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"
