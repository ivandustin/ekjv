Here are the edited lines:
These are the generations of Esau, who is also known as Edom.
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, who was the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
And Bashemath, the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebajoth.
Adah bore Esau a son named Eliphaz, and Bashemath bore him Reuel;
Aholibamah bore him Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, born to him in the land of Canaan.
Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, and all the members of his household, along with his cattle, beasts, and all his possessions that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he moved away from his brother Jacob.
Their wealth was too great for them to live together, and the land where they were residing could not support them because of their livestock.
Thus, Esau settled in the region of Mount Seir; Esau is Edom.
These are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in Mount Seir:
The names of Esau's sons are as follows: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, Esau's wife, and Reuel, the son of Bashemath, Esau's wife.
