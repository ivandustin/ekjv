When Rachel realized that she had not borne Jacob any children, she envied her sister and said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I will die."
Jacob's anger was stirred against Rachel, and he replied, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
Rachel then said, "Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear on my behalf, so that I may also have children through her."
So she gave Bilhah, her handmaid, to Jacob as a wife, and he went in to her.
Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
Rachel exclaimed, "God has judged me and has heard my voice; He has given me a son." Therefore, she named him Dan.
Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Rachel said, "I have wrestled hard with my sister and have prevailed," so she named him Naphtali.
When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son.
Leah said, "A troop comes," and she named him Gad.
Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son.
Leah said, "I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed," and she named him Asher.
During the wheat harvest, Reuben found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
Leah replied, "Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes as well?" Rachel said, "Then he shall lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my maid to my husband," and she named him Issachar.
Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will dwell with me, for I have borne him six sons." She named him Zebulun.
Afterward, she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
God remembered Rachel, listened to her, and opened her womb.
She conceived and bore a son, saying, "God has taken away my reproach."
She named him Joseph, saying, "The LORD shall add to me another son."
After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country.
Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go, for you know my service which I have done for you."
Laban replied, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay, for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me because of you."
Jacob said, "Name your wages, and I will give it."
He replied, "You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me.
For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude; the LORD has blessed you since my coming. Now, when will I provide for my own house?"
Laban asked, "What shall I give you?" Jacob answered, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.
I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep and all the brown sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these will be my wages.
So my righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when it comes for my wages before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the lambs will be considered stolen."
Laban said, "Behold, let it be according to your word."
That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the lambs, and gave them into the hands of his sons.
He set a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
Jacob took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white strips in them, exposing the white of the rods.
He set the rods that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the watering troughs, so that they would conceive when they came to drink.
The flocks conceived in front of the rods and bore young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the brown in Laban's flock. He put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban's cattle.
Whenever the stronger cattle conceived, Jacob laid the rods before their eyes in the troughs, so they would conceive among the rods.
But when the cattle were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
The man increased exceedingly and had large flocks, maidservants, menservants, camels, and donkeys.
