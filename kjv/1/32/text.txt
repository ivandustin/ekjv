And Jacob continued on his journey, and the angels of God encountered him.  
When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, "This is God's camp," and named that place Mahanaim.  
Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom.  
He instructed them, saying, "You shall say to my lord Esau: Your servant Jacob says, 'I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now.  
I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and servants: I am sending this message to my lord to find favor in your sight.'"  
The messengers returned to Jacob, reporting, "We went to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, along with four hundred men."  
Jacob was very afraid and distressed; he divided the people with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two groups.  
He said, "If Esau comes to one group and attacks it, then the other group that is left will escape."  
Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do you good.'  
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth you have shown to your servant; for I crossed this Jordan with only my staff, and now I have become two groups.  
Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, the mothers and the children.  
You said, 'I will surely do you good and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted for multitude.'"  
He spent that night there and took a portion of what he had on hand as a gift for his brother Esau.  
Two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,  
Thirty nursing camels with their calves, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten foals.  
He put them in the care of his servants, each drove by itself, and instructed his servants, "Go ahead of me and put some distance between the herds."  
He commanded the first servant, saying, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these in front of you?'  
Then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he is also behind us.'"  
He instructed the second and third servants, and all who followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau when you find him.  
And say, 'Your servant Jacob is behind us.' For he thought, 'I will appease him with the gift that goes ahead of me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.'"  
So the gift went on ahead of him, but he himself spent that night in the camp.  
He rose up that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.  
He took them and sent them across the stream, and sent over all that he had.  
Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.  
When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip; so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.  
The man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."  
The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.  
Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome."  
Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" And he blessed him there.  
Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been spared."  
As he crossed over Peniel, the sun rose above him, and he limped because of his hip.  
Therefore, the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip to this day, because the man touched the socket of Jacob's hip near the tendon.
