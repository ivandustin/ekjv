And God spoke to Jacob, saying, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; make an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
Then Jacob addressed his household and all those with him, saying, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments."
"Let us arise and go up to Bethel; I will make an altar to God, who answered me in my distress and was with me on my journey."
They gave Jacob all the foreign gods in their possession and the earrings from their ears; Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.
They journeyed on, and the terror of God fell upon the cities around them, so they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Jacob arrived at Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, along with all the people with him.
He built an altar there and named the place Elbethel, because God had appeared to him there when he fled from his brother.
Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak; the place was named Allonbachuth.
God appeared to Jacob again as he came from Padanaram and blessed him.
God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; you shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he named him Israel.
God declared, "I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you."
"I will give you the land I gave to Abraham and Isaac, and to your descendants after you, I will give this land."
God ascended from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
Jacob set up a stone pillar in the place where God had spoken with him, pouring a drink offering and oil on it.
Jacob named the place where God spoke with him Bethel.
They journeyed from Bethel, and there was only a short distance to Ephrath; Rachel went into labor and had a difficult delivery.
As she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Do not fear; you will have this son as well."
As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin.
Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; that pillar marks Rachel's grave to this day.
Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant: Dan and Naphtali.
The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Padanaram.
Jacob went to his father Isaac at Mamre, to the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had lived.
Isaac lived for one hundred and eighty years.
Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
