And the entire earth spoke a single language and shared the same words.
As they traveled eastward, they discovered a plain in the land of Shinar, where they settled.
They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them." They used bricks instead of stone and tar for mortar.
They declared, "Come, let us build a city and a tower that reaches to the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, so we won't be scattered across the earth."
The LORD descended to observe the city and the tower that the children of men were building.
The LORD said, "Look, the people are united, and they all speak the same language. This is just the beginning of what they will do; now nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them."
"Come, let us go down and confuse their language, so they will not understand each other."
So the LORD scattered them from there across the entire earth, and they stopped building the city.
That is why it was called Babel, because the LORD confused the language of the whole earth there, and from that place, the LORD scattered them across the earth.

Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was the father of Milcah and Iscah.
But Sarai was unable to have children; she had no child.
