Then Joseph could no longer control himself in front of all those who stood by him; he cried out, "Cause every man to leave me." So no one remained with him while Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers.  
He wept loudly, and the Egyptians and the household of Pharaoh heard him.  
Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph; is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not respond, for they were terrified at his presence.  
Joseph urged his brothers, "Come closer to me, please." They approached, and he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."  
"Therefore, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves for selling me here, for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life."  
"For two years, the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years to come, during which there will be neither plowing nor harvest."  
"God sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival and to save your lives through a great deliverance."  
"So it was not you who sent me here, but God; He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."  
"Hurry, go to my father and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay.'"  
"You shall live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me, you and your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have."  
"I will provide for you there, for there are still five years of famine, so that you and your household and all that you have do not come to poverty."  
"Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you."  
"And you shall tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and all that you have seen; hurry and bring my father down here."  
He embraced his brother Benjamin and wept; Benjamin wept on his neck.  
Moreover, he kissed all his brothers and wept over them; afterward, his brothers talked with him.  
The news reached Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come," and it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.  
Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers this: Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan;  
Take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land."  
"Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come."  
"Do not worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours."  
The children of Israel did as they were instructed; Joseph provided them with wagons according to Pharaoh's command and gave them provisions for the journey.  
To each of them, he gave changes of clothing, but to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.  
To his father, he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for the journey.  
He sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he instructed them, "See that you do not quarrel on the way."  
They left Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob,  
and they told him, "Joseph is still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt." Jacob's heart became numb, for he did not believe them.  
They told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them; when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.  
Israel said, "It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
