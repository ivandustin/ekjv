And Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years old; these were the years of Sarah's life.
And Sarah died in Kirjatharba, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
And Abraham rose from beside his deceased wife and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
"I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; grant me a possession of a burial site so that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
The children of Heth replied to Abraham, saying,
"Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us; in the choice of our tombs, bury your dead; none of us will withhold his tomb from you, so that you may bury your dead."
Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
He conversed with them, saying, "If it is your wish that I should bury my dead out of my sight, please listen to me and speak to Ephron the son of Zohar on my behalf,
That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is at the end of his field; I will pay the full price for it as a burial site among you."
Ephron lived among the children of Heth, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the children of Heth, and all who entered the gate of his city, saying,
"No, my lord, listen to me: I give you the field, and the cave that is in it; I give it to you in the presence of my people; bury your dead."
Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
He spoke to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, saying, "If you will give it, please listen to me: I will pay you the price for the field; accept it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
Ephron answered Abraham, saying,
"My lord, listen to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between you and me? Therefore, bury your dead."
Abraham listened to Ephron, and he weighed out for Ephron the silver he had named in the presence of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the merchant's standard.
The field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, near Mamre, along with the cave that was in it and all the trees in the field, within its borders, was confirmed
To Abraham as a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who entered the gate of his city.
After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
The field and the cave that is in it were confirmed to Abraham as a burial site by the sons of Heth.
