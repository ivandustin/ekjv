Two angels arrived in Sodom at evening; Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed his face to the ground.
He said, "Please, my lords, turn in to your servant's house, stay the night, wash your feet, and you can rise early to continue your journey." They replied, "No, we will stay in the street all night."
Lot insisted strongly, and they agreed to stay with him. He brought them into his house, prepared a feast, and baked unleavened bread for them to eat.
Before they lay down, the men of the city, both young and old, surrounded the house from every direction.
They called out to Lot, asking, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can know them."
Lot went outside to them and shut the door behind him.
He pleaded, "Please, my brothers, do not act so wickedly."
"Look, I have two daughters who have never known a man; let me bring them out to you, and you can do to them as you see fit. Just do not harm these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."
They responded, "Stand back! This man came to stay with us, and now he wants to judge us. We will treat you worse than them." They pressed hard against Lot and were about to break down the door.
But the men reached out, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door.
They struck the men outside the door with blindness, both small and great, so that they could not find the door.
The men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else in the city? Bring them out of this place.
We are about to destroy this city, for the outcry against it has grown great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, saying, "Get up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy this city." But he seemed to them like someone joking.
When morning came, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city."
While he hesitated, the men took hold of his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the LORD being merciful to him. They brought him out and set him outside the city.
Once they had brought them outside, one of the angels said, "Flee for your life! Do not look back or stop anywhere in the plain; flee to the mountains, or you will be consumed."
Lot replied, "Oh no, my lord!
Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown great mercy in saving my life. I cannot escape to the mountains, or some disaster will overtake me and I will die.
Look, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a small one. Let me escape there (is it not a small one?), and my life will be saved."
The angel said to him, "I grant you this request as well; I will not overthrow the city you mentioned.
Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore, the city was named Zoar.
The sun had risen on the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven.
He overthrew those cities, the entire plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, along with everything that grew on the ground.
But Lot's wife looked back and became a pillar of salt.
Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and saw smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace.
When God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the midst of the destruction when He overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
Lot went up from Zoar and settled in the mountains with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to us as is customary in all the earth.
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him so that we may preserve our family line through our father."
They made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He was not aware of when she lay down or when she got up.
The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "I lay with my father last night. Let us make him drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so that we may preserve our family line through our father."
They made their father drink wine that night as well, and the younger daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of when she lay down or when she got up.
Both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
