And it came to pass at that time that Judah separated himself from his brothers and went to stay with a certain Adullamite named Hirah.  
Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite named Shuah; he took her as his wife and went in unto her.  
She conceived and bore a son, and he named him Er.  
She conceived again and bore a son, and she named him Onan.  
She conceived once more and bore a son, whom she named Shelah; he was at Chezib when she gave birth to him.  
Judah took a wife for his firstborn son Er, and her name was Tamar.  
Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.  
Judah said to Onan, "Go in unto your brother's wife, marry her, and raise up offspring for your brother."  
Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in unto his brother's wife, he spilled his seed on the ground to avoid giving offspring to his brother.  
What he did displeased the LORD, so the LORD also put him to death.  
Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up," for he thought, "Lest he also die like his brothers." Tamar went and lived in her father's house.  
After a time, the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, died; Judah was comforted and went up to Timnath to shear his sheep, accompanied by his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  
Tamar was informed, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnath to shear his sheep."  
She removed her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself, and sat in an open place by the road to Timnath, for she saw that Shelah was grown, but she had not been given to him as a wife.  
When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot because she had covered her face.  
He turned to her along the way and said, "Please let me come in unto you," not realizing she was his daughter-in-law. She asked, "What will you give me for coming in unto me?"  
He replied, "I will send you a kid from the flock." She said, "Will you give me a pledge until you send it?"  
He asked, "What pledge shall I give you?" She answered, "Your signet, your bracelets, and the staff that is in your hand." He gave them to her, went in unto her, and she conceived by him.  
She arose, went away, laid aside her veil, and put on her widow's garments.  
Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to retrieve his pledge from the woman, but he could not find her.  
He asked the men of that place, "Where is the harlot who was openly by the roadside?" They replied, "There has been no harlot here."  
He returned to Judah and said, "I cannot find her; and the men of the place say there was no harlot there."  
Judah said, "Let her keep the things, lest we be shamed; I sent this kid, and you have not found her."  
About three months later, Judah was told, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the harlot, and behold, she is with child by whoredom." Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned."  
When she was brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man to whom these belong, I am with child. Please discern whose these are: the signet, the bracelets, and the staff."  
Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son." He did not know her again.  
It came to pass, at the time of her labor, that behold, twins were in her womb.  
When she was in labor, one put out his hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread around his hand, saying, "This one came out first."  
But as he withdrew his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, "How have you broken forth? This breach be upon you." Therefore, he was named Pharez.  
Afterward, his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and he was named Zarah.
