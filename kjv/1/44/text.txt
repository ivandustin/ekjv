He commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and place every man's money at the opening of his sack."
"Also, put my silver cup in the mouth of the youngest's sack, along with his corn money." The steward did as Joseph instructed.
As soon as morning broke, the men were sent away, along with their donkeys.
Once they had left the city and were not far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Go, pursue the men; and when you catch up to them, ask them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?'"
"Isn't this the cup from which my lord drinks and by which he divines? You have done wrong in doing this."
The steward caught up with them and spoke these same words.
They replied, "Why does my lord say such things? God forbid that your servants would do anything like this!
Look, the money we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?"
"Whichever of your servants it is found with, let him die, and we will be my lord's bondmen."
He said, "Let it be as you have said: he with whom it is found shall be my servant, and you shall be blameless."
Then they quickly lowered each man's sack to the ground and opened them.
He searched, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
They tore their clothes, loaded every manâ€™s donkey, and returned to the city.
Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, for he was still there, and they fell before him on the ground.
Joseph asked them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
Judah replied, "What can we say to my lord? How can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has uncovered the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and the one with whom the cup was found."
Joseph said, "God forbid that I should do so! The man in whose hand the cup is found shall be my servant; as for you, go in peace to your father."
Then Judah approached him and said, "Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are even as Pharaoh."
"My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'"
We answered my lord, "We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him."
You said to your servants, "Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
We said to my lord, "The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
You said to your servants, "Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more."
When we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Our father said, "Go again and buy us a little food."
We replied, "We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us."
Your servant my father said to us, "You know that my wife bore me two sons.
The one went out from me, and I said, 'Surely he is torn in pieces,' and I have not seen him since.
If you take this one also from me and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
Now, when I go to your servant my father and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad's life,
it will come to pass that when he sees the lad is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, "If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame to my father forever."
Now, I pray you, let your servant remain instead of the lad as a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
For how can I go up to my father if the lad is not with me? I fear I will see the evil that will come upon my father.
