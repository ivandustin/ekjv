And Adam recognized Eve, his wife; and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain, saying, "I have acquired a man with the help of the LORD."  
She then gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, while Cain was a farmer.  
As time passed, Cain brought an offering of the fruits of the ground to the LORD.  
Abel also brought an offering, the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The LORD looked favorably upon Abel and his offering,  
but He did not look favorably upon Cain and his offering. This made Cain very angry, and his expression fell.  
The LORD asked Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has your expression fallen?  
If you do well, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must rule over it."  
Cain spoke to Abel, his brother, and when they were in the field, Cain attacked Abel and killed him.  
The LORD asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain replied, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"  
The LORD said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.  
Now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  
When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."  
Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.  
You have driven me away from the land and from your presence; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer, and anyone who finds me will kill me."  
The LORD replied, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." The LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.  
Cain left the LORD's presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  
Cain knew his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son, Enoch.  
To Enoch was born Irad; Irad fathered Mehujael; Mehujael fathered Methusael; and Methusael fathered Lamech.  
Lamech took two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other was Zillah.  
Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.  
His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.  
Zillah also bore Tubalcain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubalcain's sister was Naamah.  
Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; wives of Lamech, hear my words: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.  
If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."  
Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."  
To Seth, a son was also born, and he named him Enos. At that time, people began to call on the name of the LORD.
