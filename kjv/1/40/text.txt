And it came to pass after these events that the king of Egypt's butler and baker had offended their lord, the king of Egypt.  
And Pharaoh was angry with two of his officials, the chief butler and the chief baker.  
He placed them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.  
The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to serve them, and they spent some time in custody.  
Both men had dreams on the same night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned.  
Joseph came in to see them in the morning and noticed that they were dejected.  
He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in the lord's house, "Why do you look so sad today?"  
They replied, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it." Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell me your dreams."  
The chief butler shared his dream with Joseph, saying, "In my dream, there was a vine before me;  
and on the vine were three branches; it was as if it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.  
Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."  
Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation: The three branches represent three days.  
Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand, as you did before when you were his butler.  
But remember me when it goes well with you, and show kindness to me, I pray, and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.  
For I was indeed stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing to deserve being put in the dungeon."  
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head.  
In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."  
Joseph answered and said, "This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.  
Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from you."  
It came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the chief baker among his servants.  
He restored the chief butler to his position, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.  
But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.  
Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
