Then Joseph approached Pharaoh and said, "My father, my brothers, their flocks, their herds, and all that they possess have come from the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are now in the land of Goshen."
He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
Pharaoh asked his brothers, "What is your occupation?" They replied, "Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers."
They further explained to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land because your servants have no pasture for their flocks; the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Therefore, we ask you to let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
The land of Egypt is before you; let your father and brothers settle in the best part of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen, and if you know of any capable men among them, appoint them as rulers over my livestock."
Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Pharaoh asked Jacob, "How old are you?"
Jacob replied, "The days of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years. Few and difficult have been the days of my life, and I have not reached the years of my fathers during their pilgrimage."
Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and then left his presence.
Joseph settled his father and brothers, giving them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best part, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Joseph provided for his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with bread, according to their families.
There was no bread in all the land, for the famine was severe, causing both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan to suffer greatly.
Joseph collected all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain they purchased, and he brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
When the money ran out in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, "Give us bread; why should we die in your presence? Our money is gone."
Joseph replied, "Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your cattle, since the money has failed."
They brought their livestock to Joseph, and he provided them with bread in exchange for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys, feeding them with bread for all their livestock for that year.
At the end of that year, they came to him the following year and said, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our land.
Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."
Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold their fields because the famine was overwhelming: thus, the land became Pharaoh's.
As for the people, he moved them to cities from one end of Egypt to the other.
Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a portion assigned to them by Pharaoh and ate their portion that Pharaoh provided; therefore, they did not sell their lands.
Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
When the harvest comes, you shall give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and the remaining four parts shall be yours for seed in the field, for your food, and for the food of your households, and for the sustenance of your little ones."
They replied, "You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
Joseph established it as a law in the land of Egypt to this day that Pharaoh should receive a fifth, except for the land of the priests, which did not become Pharaoh's.
Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen; they acquired property there, and they were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, so the total lifespan of Jacob was one hundred and forty-seven years.
As the time approached for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me; do not bury me in Egypt.
But let me lie with my fathers, and carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." Joseph replied, "I will do as you have said."
Jacob then said, "Swear to me." And Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed down at the head of the bed.
