And the famine was severe in the land.
And it came to pass, when they had consumed the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again, buy us a little food."
And Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you;
But if you do not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
And Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man you had another brother?"
And they replied, "The man asked us pointedly about our situation and our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' We answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"
And Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will rise and go, so that we may live and not die, both we and you, and also our little ones.
I will be responsible for him; you may hold me accountable. If I do not bring him back to you and present him to you, then let me bear the blame forever.
For if we had not delayed, we would have returned twice by now."
And their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: take the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man a giftâ€”a little balm, a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
And take double the money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it back in your hand; perhaps it was a mistake.
Take also your brother, and rise, go again to the man.
And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
And the men took the gift, and they took double the money in their hands along with Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring these men to my home, and slaughter an animal and prepare it, for these men will dine with me at noon."
And the steward did as Joseph instructed, and he brought the men into Joseph's house.
And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, "It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, so that he may attack us, seize us as slaves, and take our donkeys."
And they approached the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the entrance of the house,
And said, "O sir, we came down the first time to buy food.
And it happened that when we came to the inn and opened our sacks, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hands.
And we have brought additional money to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks."
And he said, "Peace be to you; do not fear. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money." And he brought Simeon out to them.
And the steward brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he provided fodder for their donkeys.
And they prepared the gift for Joseph's arrival at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the gift that was in their hand into the house, and they bowed down to him to the ground.
And he asked them about their well-being, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
And they answered, "Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
And Joseph hurried out, for his emotions were stirred for his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.
And he washed his face, and went out, and restrained himself, and said, "Serve the food."
And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement.
And he took portions from his own table and gave them to them, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.
