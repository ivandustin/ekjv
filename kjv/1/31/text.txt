And he overheard the words of Laban's sons, who said, "Jacob has taken away everything that belonged to our father; and from what was our father's, he has gained all this wealth."  
And Jacob noticed Laban's demeanor, and, behold, it was not favorable toward him as it had been before.  
And the LORD spoke to Jacob, saying, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives; I will be with you."  
Jacob then summoned Rachel and Leah to the field where his flock was,  
and said to them, "I see that your father's demeanor is not favorable toward me as it was before; but the God of my father has been with me."  
"You know that I have served your father with all my strength."  
"Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but God did not allow him to harm me."  
"If he said, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the cattle bore speckled; and if he said, 'The ringstraked shall be your hire,' then all the cattle bore ringstraked."  
"Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me."  
At the time when the cattle conceived, I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream that the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.  
And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, "Jacob." And I replied, "Here I am."  
He said, "Lift up your eyes and see that all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you."  
"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a vow to me: now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your relatives."  
Rachel and Leah responded, "Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  
Are we not considered strangers to him? For he has sold us and consumed our money."  
"For all the wealth that God has taken from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do."  
Then Jacob rose up and placed his sons and wives on camels;  
and he took all his livestock and goods that he had acquired, the livestock he had obtained in Padanaram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.  
Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen her father's household idols.  
Jacob left secretly, not telling Laban that he was fleeing.  
So he fled with all that he had; he crossed the river and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.  
On the third day, Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.  
He took his brothers with him and pursued Jacob for seven days, finally catching up with him in the mountain of Gilead.  
God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream at night and said to him, "Take heed that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."  
Laban caught up with Jacob, who had pitched his tent in the mountain; Laban and his brothers pitched their tents in the mountain of Gilead.  
Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done that you have stolen away secretly from me and carried away my daughters like captives taken with the sword?  
Why did you flee away secretly and not tell me, so that I could have sent you away with joy, with songs, with tambourine, and with harp?  
And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and daughters? You have acted foolishly in doing this."  
"It is in my power to harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.'"  
"And now, although you long to return to your father's house, why have you stolen my gods?"  
Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought you might take your daughters from me by force."  
"Whomever you find your gods with, let him not live; before our relatives, identify what is yours with me and take it." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.  
Laban searched Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, and the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.  
Rachel had taken the idols and hidden them in the camel's saddle, sitting on them. Laban searched the entire tent but found nothing.  
She said to her father, "Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me." He searched but did not find the idols.  
Jacob became angry and argued with Laban, saying, "What is my offense? What is my sin that you have pursued me so fiercely?  
Although you have searched all my belongings, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my relatives and yours, so they may judge between us."  
"For twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.  
If any were torn by beasts, I did not bring them to you; I bore the loss myself. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."  
"This is how I was: in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; my sleep fled from my eyes."  
"I have been in your house for twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times."  
"Except for the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."  
Laban replied to Jacob, "These daughters are my daughters, these children are my children, and these livestock are my livestock; everything you see is mine. What can I do today to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?  
Now, therefore, come, let us make a covenant, I and you; let it be a witness between us."  
Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.  
Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.  
Laban called it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.  
Laban said, "This heap is a witness between me and you today." Therefore, the name was called Galeed;  
and Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between me and you when we are absent from one another.  
If you afflict my daughters or take other wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you."  
Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and this pillar, which I have set between me and you:  
This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me for harm."  
"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.  
Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his relatives to eat bread; they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.  
Early in the morning, Laban rose, kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them; then Laban departed and returned to his place.
