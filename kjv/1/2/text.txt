Thus, the heavens and the earth were completed, along with all their hosts.  
On the seventh day, God finished His work that He had done; He rested on the seventh day from all His labor.  
God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all His work of creation.  
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.  
Every plant of the field had not yet sprung up, and every herb of the field had not yet grown, for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.  
But a mist rose from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground.  
The LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; thus, man became a living being.  
The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, eastward, and placed the man there whom He had formed.  
From the ground, the LORD God made every tree grow that is pleasing to the eye and good for food; the tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, along with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  
A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four branches.  
The name of the first is Pison; it encircles the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.  
The gold of that land is good; there is also bdellium and onyx stone.  
The name of the second river is Gihon; it encircles the entire land of Cush.  
The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it flows east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.  
The LORD God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.  
The LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat from every tree in the garden;  
but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it, you will certainly die."  
The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper suitable for him."  
From the ground, the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.  
Adam gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam, no suitable helper was found.  
The LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and while he slept, He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.  
The rib that the LORD God had taken from man, He made into a woman and brought her to the man.  
Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, for she was taken out of Man."  
Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.  
Both the man and his wife were naked, and they felt no shame.
