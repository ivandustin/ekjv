And it came to pass after these events that someone informed Joseph, "Behold, your father is ill." He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.  
And someone told Jacob, saying, "Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you." Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed.  
Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,  
and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I will make you a multitude of people and give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.'  
Now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.  
Your offspring, which you beget after them, shall be yours and shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.  
As for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still a little distance to go to Ephrath; I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.  
Israel looked at Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are these?"  
Joseph replied to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place." He said, "Bring them to me, please, so that I may bless them."  
Now Israel's eyes were dim with age, so he could not see. Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.  
Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face, and now God has shown me your descendants as well."  
Joseph took them from between his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.  
Joseph positioned them both, placing Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.  
Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands intentionally, for Manasseh was the firstborn.  
He blessed Joseph, saying, "God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,  
the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."  
When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him; he held up his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.  
Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."  
But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know; he too shall become a people, and he too shall be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."  
He blessed them that day, saying, "In you shall Israel bless, saying, 'God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" Thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  
Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.  
Furthermore, I have given you one portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."
