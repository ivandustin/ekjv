And Jesus responded, speaking to them again through parables, saying,  
"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who prepared a marriage feast for his son.  
He sent out his servants to invite those who were invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.  
Again, he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready: come to the wedding.'  
But they disregarded it and went their separate ways, one to his farm and another to his business.  
The rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them.  
When the king heard this, he was furious; he sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.  
Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.  
Go therefore into the highways, and invite as many as you find to the wedding.'  
So the servants went out into the highways and gathered together all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.  
When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding garment.  
He said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And the man was speechless.  
Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'  
For many are called, but few are chosen.  
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap him in his words.  
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not influenced by appearances.  
Tell us, therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?'  
But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, 'Why do you test me, you hypocrites?  
Show me the tax money.' And they brought him a denarius.  
He asked them, 'Whose image and inscription is this?'  
They replied, 'Caesar's.' Then he said to them, 'Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'  
When they heard these words, they marveled and left him, going their way.  
On the same day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,  
'Teacher, Moses said, "If a man dies having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother."  
Now there were with us seven brothers; the first married and died, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.  
Likewise, the second also, and the third, up to the seventh.  
Last of all, the woman died.  
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.'  
Jesus answered and said to them, 'You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.  
For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.  
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,  
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.'  
When the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.  
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.  
Then one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him, saying,  
'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?'  
Jesus said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.  
This is the first and greatest commandment.  
And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.'  
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,  
'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'  
He said to them, 'How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,  
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool'?"  
If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?'  
And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day forward to ask him any more questions."
