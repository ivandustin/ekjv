Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
The foolish took their lamps but did not take oil with them.
But the wise took oil in their vessels along with their lamps.
While the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
And at midnight, a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom comes; go out to meet him.
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there not be enough for us and you: rather, go to those who sell and buy for yourselves.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
Afterward, the other virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man comes.
For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered to them his goods.
And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability; and immediately took his journey.
Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents.
Likewise, he who had received two gained two more.
But he who had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money.
After a long time, the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
And so he who had received five talents came and brought five more talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained five more talents beside them.
His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things; I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.
He who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained two more talents beside them.
His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things; I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your lord.
Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth; here you have what is yours.
His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and lazy servant; you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.
You ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I would have received my own with interest.
Take therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents.
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
And before him will be gathered all nations, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.
And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Then the King will say to those on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in.
Naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? or thirsty, and give you drink?
When did we see you a stranger and take you in? or naked, and clothe you?
Or when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?
And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.
Then he will also say to those on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?
Then he will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.
And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
