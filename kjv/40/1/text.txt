The genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David and the son of Abraham, is as follows:  
Abraham fathered Isaac; Isaac fathered Jacob; Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers;  
Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar; Perez fathered Hezron; Hezron fathered Ram;  
Ram fathered Amminadab; Amminadab fathered Nahshon; Nahshon fathered Salmon;  
Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab; Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth; Obed fathered Jesse;  
Jesse fathered David the king; David the king fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah;  
Solomon fathered Rehoboam; Rehoboam fathered Abijah; Abijah fathered Asa;  
Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat fathered Joram; Joram fathered Uzziah;  
Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; Ahaz fathered Hezekiah;  
Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; Amon fathered Josiah;  
Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.  
After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel; Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel;  
Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; Abiud fathered Eliakim; Eliakim fathered Azor;  
Azor fathered Zadok; Zadok fathered Achim; Achim fathered Elihud;  
Elihud fathered Eleazar; Eleazar fathered Matthan; Matthan fathered Jacob;  
Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  
Thus, there are fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile in Babylon to Christ.  
Now the birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way: When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.  
Then Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to divorce her quietly.  
But while he was considering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.  
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name JESUS, for he will save his people from their sins."  
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying,  
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which means, "God with us."  
When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took Mary as his wife,  
but knew her not until she had given birth to her firstborn son; and he called his name JESUS.
