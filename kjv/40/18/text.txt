At that time, the disciples approached Jesus, asking, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to Him and placed the child in their midst.
He said, "Truly, I tell you, unless you are converted and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"And whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me."
"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
"Woe to the world because of offenses! For it is necessary that offenses come; but woe to the man through whom the offense comes!"
"If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire."
"And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire."
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
"For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost."
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is lost?"
"And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray."
"Even so, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish."
"Moreover, if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
"But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses."
"And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
"Truly, I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
"Again, I tell you that if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them."
Then Peter came to Him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy times seven."
"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
"As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him."
"Since he was unable to pay, the master ordered that he be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, to repay the debt."
"The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'"
"The master took pity on him, canceled the debt, and let him go."
"But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded."
"His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'"
"But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt."
"When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened."
"Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'"
"In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed."
"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."
