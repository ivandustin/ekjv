When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  
And behold, a leper approached and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."  
Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be clean." Immediately, his leprosy was cleansed.  
Jesus instructed him, "See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded as a testimony to them."  
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him,  
saying, "Lord, my servant is at home, sick with paralysis, and is suffering greatly."  
Jesus replied, "I will come and heal him."  
The centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof; just say the word, and my servant will be healed."  
For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."  
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those following him, "Truly, I tell you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel."  
And I tell you, many will come from the east and west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.  
But the children of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that very hour.  
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.  
He touched her hand, and the fever left her; she got up and began to serve them.  
When evening came, they brought to him many who were possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,  
fulfilling what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases."  
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.  
A certain scribe approached and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."  
Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."  
Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."  
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."  
When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.  
Suddenly, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves; but he was asleep.  
His disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!"  
He said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.  
The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"  
When he arrived on the other side, in the region of the Gergesenes, two men possessed by demons met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.  
And behold, they cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?"  
A large herd of pigs was feeding at a distance from them.  
The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."  
He said to them, "Go." And when they had come out, they went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.  
The herdsmen fled and went into the city, telling everything that had happened, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.  
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
