At that time, Jesus walked through the cornfields on the Sabbath; his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the ears of corn to eat.  
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath."  
He replied, "Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?  
How he entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the priests?  
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath days, the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are blameless?  
But I tell you, there is something greater than the temple here.  
If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.  
For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."  
After leaving there, he went into their synagogue,  
and behold, there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" hoping to accuse him.  
He said to them, "Which of you, if you have a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?  
How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."  
Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, as healthy as the other.  
Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against him, plotting how they might destroy him.  
But when Jesus became aware of this, he withdrew from there, and large crowds followed him, and he healed them all.  
He warned them not to make him known,  
to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying,  
"Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.  
He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.  
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory.  
And in his name, the Gentiles will hope."  
Then a man who was possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the blind and mute both spoke and saw.  
All the people were amazed and said, "Is this not the son of David?"  
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."  
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.  
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?  
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.  
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.  
Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.  
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.  
Therefore, I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.  
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.  
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.  
O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.  
A good person out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things, and an evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.  
But I say to you that for every idle word people speak, they will give account on the day of judgment.  
For by your words, you will be justified, and by your words, you will be condemned."  
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."  
But he answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.  
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  
The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.  
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  
When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through dry places seeking rest and finds none.  
Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.  
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So it will also be with this wicked generation."  
While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, wanting to speak with him.  
Then someone said to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you."  
But he answered and said to the one who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"  
And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!  
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
