And Saul was approving of his death. At that time, there was a significant persecution against the church in Jerusalem, leading to the scattering of all except the apostles throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
Devout men took Stephen for burial and mourned deeply for him.
As for Saul, he wreaked havoc on the church, entering every house and dragging off men and women to prison.
Consequently, those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word.
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.
The people, united in spirit, paid close attention to what Philip said, witnessing the miracles he performed.
Unclean spirits cried out with loud voices and came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
This brought great joy to that city.
However, there was a certain man named Simon who previously practiced sorcery in that city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
To him, all the people, from the least to the greatest, paid attention, saying, "This man is the great power of God."
They regarded him because he had long amazed them with his sorceries.
But when they believed Philip's message about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized, he stayed close to Philip, amazed by the miracles and signs he witnessed.
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
Upon their arrival, they prayed for the new believers to receive the Holy Spirit,
(For the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the apostles' laying on of hands, he offered them money,
Saying, "Give me also this power, so that anyone I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
But Peter replied, "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money.
You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."
Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."
After they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza," which is a desert road.
So he got up and went; and there he encountered an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
and was now returning, sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.
The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."
Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. He asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
The eunuch replied, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
The passage of Scripture he was reading was this: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."
The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
As they traveled along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?"
Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." The eunuch answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
He ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
