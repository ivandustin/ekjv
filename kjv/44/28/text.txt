And when they escaped, they realized that the island was called Melita.  
The local people showed us considerable kindness; they kindled a fire and welcomed each of us because of the rain and the cold.  
As Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper emerged from the heat and fastened itself to his hand.  
When the locals saw the venomous snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer; although he has escaped the sea, vengeance does not allow him to live."  
He shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.  
However, they expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds and declared that he was a god.  
In that region were the estates of the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and graciously entertained us for three days.  
It happened that Publius's father was sick with a fever and dysentery; Paul went in to him, prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.  
After this had happened, others on the island who had diseases came and were healed as well.  
They also honored us in many ways, and when we departed, they provided us with supplies we needed.  
After three months, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island, whose figurehead was Castor and Pollux.  
Upon landing at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.  
From there, we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium; after one day, the south wind blew, and we reached Puteoli the next day.  
There we found fellow believers who urged us to stay with them for seven days, and so we made our way to Rome.  
When the believers in Rome heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns; when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.  
Upon our arrival in Rome, the centurion handed the prisoners over to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier assigned to guard him.  
After three days, Paul called together the leaders of the Jews; when they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans."  
After examining me, the Romans wanted to release me because they found no basis for a death sentence against me.  
But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—not that I had any charge to bring against my own people.  
For this reason, I have called for you, to see you and speak with you; it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.  
They replied, "We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brothers who have come here has reported or said anything bad about you.  
But we want to hear your views, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect."  
They set a day to meet with him, and many came to the place where he was staying; he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.  
Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.  
They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet:  
'Go to this people and say, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving."  
For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.'  
Therefore, I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!"  
After he said this, the Jews left, arguing vigorously among themselves.  
For two whole years, Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.  
He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance.
