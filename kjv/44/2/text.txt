And when the day of Pentecost had fully arrived, they were all together in one place, united in purpose.  
Suddenly, a sound came from heaven like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.  
Then, cloven tongues resembling fire appeared to them, resting on each of them.  
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit enabled them.  
In Jerusalem, there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing there.  
When this sound was heard, the multitude gathered and was bewildered, for each one heard them speaking in his own language.  
Amazed and astonished, they said to one another, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?"  
And how is it that we hear each of us in our own native language?  
Parthians, Medes, Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,  
Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Libya near Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism,  
Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues.  
All were amazed and perplexed, asking one another, "What does this mean?"  
Others mocked them, saying, "They are filled with new wine."  
But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words:  
These men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.  
This is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:  
'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.  
Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.  
I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.  
The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.  
And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'  
Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.  
This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.  
But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.  
David said about him: 'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope,  
because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay.  
You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'  
Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.  
But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.  
Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.  
God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.  
Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.  
For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand  
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'  
Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah."  
When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"  
Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  
The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call."  
With many other words, he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."  
Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.  
They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.  
Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.  
All the believers were together and had everything in common.  
They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.  
Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,  
praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
