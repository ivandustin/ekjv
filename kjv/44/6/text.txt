In those days, as the number of disciples increased, a complaint arose from the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
The twelve apostles gathered the disciples together and said, "It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables."
Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we can appoint to this task.
But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
This proposal pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.
They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
The word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased significantly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
Then some members of the synagogue, known as the synagogue of the Libertines, along with Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, began to argue with Stephen.
But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
Then they secretly instigated men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council.
They produced false witnesses who testified, "This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
All who were sitting in the council looked intently at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
