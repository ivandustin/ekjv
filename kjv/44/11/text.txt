The apostles and brethren in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
When Peter arrived in Jerusalem, those of the circumcision argued with him,
Saying, "You went to men uncircumcised and ate with them."
But Peter explained the situation from the beginning, laying it out for them, saying,
"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance, I saw a vision: a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me.
As I looked closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
I heard a voice saying to me, 'Arise, Peter; kill and eat.'
But I replied, 'Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
The voice answered me again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed, you must not call common.'
This happened three times, and then all were drawn up again into heaven.
And behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
The Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover, these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
He showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, 'Send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.'
As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as it did upon us at the beginning.
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
Since God gave them the same gift as He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could withstand God?
When they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, 'Then God has also granted repentance unto life to the Gentiles.'
Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose concerning Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only.
Some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
News of these things reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a large number of people were added to the Lord.
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul.
When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year, they met with the church and taught a great many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
During those days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
One of them, named Agabus, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there would be a great famine throughout the world, which occurred during the reign of Claudius Caesar.
The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brethren living in Judaea.
They did this, sending their gift to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
