Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour.
A certain man, lame from his mother's womb, was carried there, and they laid him daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask for alms from those entering the temple.
Seeing Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked them for alms.
Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, "Look at us."
The man paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.
Then Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have; but what I do have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
He took him by the right hand and lifted him up; immediately, his feet and ankle bones received strength.
He leaped up, stood, walked, and entered the temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.
All the people saw him walking and praising God.
They recognized him as the man who sat begging at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
As the healed lame man clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's, greatly amazed.
When Peter saw this, he addressed the people, "Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you gaze at us as if by our own power or holiness we made this man walk?"
The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to release Him.
But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you;
And you killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead; of which we are witnesses.
And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know; yes, the faith that comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.
And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
Repent therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing come from the presence of the Lord.
And He will send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before:
Whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.
For Moses truly said to the fathers, "The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren; Him you shall hear in all things whatever He says to you."
And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.
You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in your seed, all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
To you first, God, having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you away from your iniquities.
