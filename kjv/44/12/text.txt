Now, during that time, King Herod extended his hand to persecute certain members of the church.
He executed James, the brother of John, by the sword.
Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he decided to arrest Peter as well. (These were the days of unleavened bread.)
After apprehending him, he imprisoned Peter and assigned four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to present him to the people after Easter.
Peter was therefore kept in prison, but the church prayed fervently to God for him.
On the night when Herod planned to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while the guards stood at the door of the prison.
Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the prison; he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." The chains fell off his hands.
The angel instructed him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." Peter did so. The angel then said, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
Peter followed him out, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.
After passing the first and second guards, they reached the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them on its own. They went out and walked down one street, and then the angel left him.
When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's grasp and from all that the Jewish people expected."
After reflecting on this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (whose surname was Mark), where many were gathered and praying.
As Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
Upon recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot to open the gate and ran in to tell everyone that Peter was standing at the gate.
They said to her, "You are out of your mind." But she insisted that it was true. They then said, "It must be his angel."
Meanwhile, Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
He motioned for them to be quiet and explained how the Lord had brought him out of prison. He said, "Go tell these things to James and the brothers." Then he left and went to another place.
As soon as it was day, there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter.
When Herod searched for him and could not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered that they be executed. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
Herod was very displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they came to him in unity, and after winning over Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they sought peace because their country depended on the king's country for food.
On a designated day, Herod, dressed in royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a speech to them.
The people shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man!"
Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God; he was eaten by worms and died.
Nevertheless, the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after completing their mission, bringing with them John, also known as Mark.
