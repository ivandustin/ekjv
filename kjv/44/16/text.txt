Then he arrived in Derbe and Lystra, where a certain disciple named Timotheus was present; he was the son of a Jewish woman who believed, but his father was a Greek.
He was well spoken of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
Paul wanted him to accompany him, so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews in that region, as they all knew his father was a Greek.
As they traveled through the cities, they delivered the decrees that had been established by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to observe.
Thus, the churches were strengthened in faith and grew in number daily.
After they had traveled through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in Asia.
When they reached Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not allow them.
As they passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
During the night, a vision appeared to Paul: a man from Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
After Paul had seen the vision, we immediately sought to go to Macedonia, convinced that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct course to Samothracia, and the following day to Neapolis.
From there, we traveled to Philippi, which is the leading city of that part of Macedonia and a Roman colony; we stayed in that city for several days.
On the Sabbath, we went outside the city to the riverside, where prayer was customary, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there.
A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple goods from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, listened to us; the Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.
After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.
As we were going to prayer, a slave girl with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling.
She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."
She continued this for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
When her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities.
They brought them to the magistrates, saying, "These men, being Jews, are causing great trouble in our city,
and they advocate customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, being Romans."
The crowd joined in the attack against them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten.
After inflicting many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
The jailer, having received such a command, put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks.
At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; immediately, all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.
When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had escaped.
But Paul shouted with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
Then the jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
He brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
At that hour of the night, he took them and washed their wounds; then he and all his household were baptized immediately.
He brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his entire household.
When it was day, the magistrates sent their officers, saying, "Release those men."
The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore, depart and go in peace."
But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly without a trial, even though we are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now do they want to send us away secretly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."
The officers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
So they came and pleaded with them and brought them out, asking them to leave the city.
After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia's house; when they had seen the brothers and sisters, they encouraged them and departed.
