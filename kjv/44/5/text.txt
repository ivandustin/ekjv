But a certain man named Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,  
And kept back part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a portion, laying it at the apostles' feet.  
But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds from the land?  
While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own power? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."  
Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; great fear came upon all who heard these things.  
The young men arose, wrapped him up, and carried him out to bury him.  
About three hours later, his wife, unaware of what had happened, came in.  
Peter asked her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for this amount?" She replied, "Yes, for that amount."  
Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."  
Immediately, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last; the young men came in, found her dead, and carried her out, burying her beside her husband.  
Great fear came upon the whole church and all who heard these things.  
By the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people; they were all together in Solomon's porch.  
None of the rest dared to join them, but the people esteemed them highly.  
More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.  
So much so that they brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, hoping that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.  
A multitude also came from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.  
Then the high priest rose up, along with all those with him (this was the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.  
They laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.  
But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,  
"Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life."  
When they heard this, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him, called the council together, along with all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.  
When the officers arrived and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported,  
"Saying, 'We found the prison securely shut, with the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.'"  
Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed about what this could lead to.  
Then someone came and told them, "Look, the men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people."  
Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.  
When they had brought them, they set them before the council, and the high priest questioned them,  
"Saying, 'Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.'"  
Then Peter and the other apostles answered, "We ought to obey God rather than men.  
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging Him on a tree.  
Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.  
And we are His witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him."  
When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them.  
Then a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the law, stood up in the council and ordered that the apostles be put outside for a little while.  
He said to them, "Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.  
For some time ago, Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.  
After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away many people after him; he also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.  
And now I say to you, refrain from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or work is of men, it will come to nothing.  
But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest you even be found to fight against God."  
They agreed with him, and when they had called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.  
So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.  
And daily in the temple and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus Christ.
