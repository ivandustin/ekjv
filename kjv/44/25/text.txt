Now, when Festus arrived in the province, he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem after three days.
The high priest and the chief Jews informed him about Paul and pleaded with him.
They sought favor against him, requesting that he send for Paul to Jerusalem, planning to ambush him on the way to kill him.
However, Festus replied that Paul would be kept in Caesarea and that he himself would depart there shortly.
"Let those among you who are able go down with me and accuse this man if there is any wrongdoing in him," he said.
After staying among them for more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded that Paul be brought before him.
When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and presented many serious accusations against him, which they could not prove.
In his defense, Paul stated, "I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews, the temple, or Caesar at all."
But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged on these matters before me?"
Paul replied, "I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know."
"If I am an offender or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing in these charges of which they accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
Then Festus, after consulting with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go."
After some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
When they had been there several days, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, saying, "There is a certain man left in chains by Felix.
About whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him.
I replied, 'It is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man to die before the accused has the accusers face to face and is given the opportunity to defend himself against the charges.'
Therefore, when they came here, I did not delay; the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth.
When the accusers stood up, they brought no charges of the kind I had expected.
Instead, they had certain questions against him regarding their own religion and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Because I was at a loss regarding such questions, I asked Paul whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged on these matters.
But when Paul appealed to be kept for the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would also like to hear the man myself." Festus replied, "Tomorrow you shall hear him."
The next day, when Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great pomp and entered the place of hearing, along with the chief captains and principal men of the city, Paul was brought forth at Festus' command.
Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men present with us, you see this man, about whom the multitude of the Jews has petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him.
I have nothing certain to write to my lord about him. Therefore, I have brought him before you, especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after examination, I may have something to write.
For it seems unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.
