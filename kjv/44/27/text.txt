And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they handed Paul and several other prisoners over to a centurion named Julius, who was part of Augustus' cohort.  
Boarding a ship from Adramyttium, we set sail, intending to navigate along the coasts of Asia; with us was Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.  
The next day, we arrived at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him the freedom to visit his friends for some rest.  
After departing from there, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were against us.  
Having crossed the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra, a city in Lycia.  
There, the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was heading to Italy, and he placed us on board.  
After sailing slowly for many days and barely making it past Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, near Salmone.  
With difficulty, we passed it and arrived at a location called The Fair Havens, close to the city of Lasea.  
As much time had passed and sailing had become perilous, since the fast was already over, Paul warned them,  
Saying, "Men, I perceive that this voyage will result in injury and great loss, not only of the cargo and ship but also of our lives."  
However, the centurion trusted the ship's captain and owner more than what Paul had said.  
Since the harbor was not suitable for wintering, most advised departing from there as well, hoping to reach Phenice, a harbor of Crete that faces southwest and northwest.  
When the south wind blew gently, thinking they had achieved their goal, they set sail close to Crete.  
But shortly after, a violent wind, called Euroclydon, arose against them.  
When the ship was caught in the storm and could not head into the wind, we let it drift.  
Sailing under a certain island called Clauda, we struggled to secure the lifeboat.  
Once they had hoisted it aboard, they used ropes to undergird the ship; fearing they might run aground on the sandbars, they lowered the sails and were driven along.  
Being severely tossed by the storm, the next day they began to lighten the ship.  
On the third day, we threw overboard the ship's tackle with our own hands.  
When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a severe storm continued to batter us, all hope of being saved was lost.  
But after a long period of abstinence, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete, thus avoiding this harm and loss."  
"And now I urge you to take heart: for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."  
"For this night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me,  
Saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'"  
"Therefore, men, take heart: for I believe God that it will be just as it was told to me.  
However, we must run aground on a certain island."  
When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed they were nearing land;  
They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.  
Fearing they might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.  
As the sailors were about to escape from the ship, having let down the lifeboat into the sea, pretending they were going to drop anchors from the bow,  
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."  
Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it drift away.  
As day was approaching, Paul urged them all to eat, saying, "This is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, having eaten nothing.  
Therefore, I urge you to take some food, for this is for your survival; not a hair will fall from the head of any of you."  
After he said this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat.  
Then they all were encouraged and took food themselves.  
In total, there were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.  
After they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.  
When morning came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they planned, if possible, to run the ship aground.  
After taking up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, untied the rudder ropes, raised the mainsail to the wind, and headed toward shore.  
But when they encountered a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, while the stern was broken by the force of the waves.  
The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners to prevent any from swimming away and escaping.  
But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their intention and ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land.  
The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on pieces of the ship. In this way, everyone safely reached the shore.
