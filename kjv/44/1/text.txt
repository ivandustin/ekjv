The former treatise I have made, O Theophilus, detailing all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
Until the day he was taken up, after he had given commandments through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
To them, he also presented himself alive after his suffering by many convincing proofs, being seen by them for forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.
And while they were assembled together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which he said they had heard from him.
For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
When they had come together, they asked him, saying, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
And he said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
And when he had said these things, as they were watching, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
And while they were gazing into heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white robes;
Who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is a Sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem.
And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room where they were staying, Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.
All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
In those days, Peter stood up among the disciples (the number of names together was about one hundred and twenty) and said,
"Men and brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
For he was numbered among us and was allotted a share in this ministry.
Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out.
And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so that field was called in their own language, Aceldama, that is, the Field of Blood.
For it is written in the Book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let no one live in it,' and 'Let another take his office.'
Therefore, it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us during all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
Beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was surnamed Justus) and Matthias.
And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two you have chosen,
To take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
