After these events, Paul left Athens and traveled to Corinth.
There, he met a Jew named Aquila, originally from Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla, due to Claudius's decree that all Jews must leave Rome.
Since Paul shared the same trade, he stayed with them and worked, as they were all tentmakers by profession.
He preached in the synagogue every Sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.
When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
When they opposed him and spoke blasphemies, he shook out his garments and declared, "Your blood is on your own heads; I am innocent; from now on, I will go to the Gentiles."
He then left and entered the house of a man named Justus, a worshiper of God, whose home was next to the synagogue.
Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.
That night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid; keep speaking and do not be silent.
For I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
Paul stayed there for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among them.
When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united in opposition to Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
Claiming, "This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are against the law."
As Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If this were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, I would have reason to listen to you, O Jews.
But if it concerns questions about words and names and your own law, you take care of it; I will not be a judge of such matters."
He then drove them away from the judgment seat.
All the Greeks then seized Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the judgment seat, and Gallio showed no concern for these matters.
After this, Paul stayed for a while longer, then said goodbye to the brothers and sailed to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila; he had his hair cut in Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.
He arrived in Ephesus and left them there, but he entered the synagogue and engaged in discussion with the Jews.
When they asked him to stay longer, he did not agree;
Instead, he said farewell, stating, "I must by all means celebrate the coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return to you if God wills." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
Upon landing at Caesarea, he went up to greet the church and then went down to Antioch.
After spending some time there, he departed and traveled through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent man and well-versed in the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus.
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was fervent in spirit; he spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, although he only knew the baptism of John.
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God more accurately.
When he intended to go to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples there, urging them to welcome him. Upon his arrival, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,
For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, demonstrating from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
