And certain men who came down from Judea taught the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised in the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved."  
When Paul and Barnabas had a significant disagreement and debate with them, they decided that Paul and Barnabas, along with some others, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders regarding this issue.  
As they were sent on their way by the church, they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, sharing the news of the Gentiles' conversion, which brought great joy to all the brethren.  
Upon arriving in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they shared all that God had accomplished through them.  
However, some members of the Pharisees who had believed rose up, stating that it was necessary to circumcise them and to instruct them to observe the law of Moses.  
The apostles and elders convened to discuss this matter.  
After much debate, Peter stood up and addressed them, saying, "Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to share the gospel with the Gentiles, so they could hear and believe."  
And God, who knows the hearts, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us;  
And He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.  
So why do you test God by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?  
We believe that it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we will be saved, just as they will.  
Then the whole assembly fell silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they shared the miraculous signs and wonders God had performed among the Gentiles through them.  
After they finished speaking, James addressed the assembly, saying, "Brothers, listen to me:  
Simeon has explained how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for His name.  
The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:  
'After this, I will return and rebuild the fallen tent of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,  
so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear My name,' says the Lord, who does these things.  
All of God's works are known to Him from the beginning of time.  
Therefore, my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.  
Instead, we should write to them, instructing them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.  
For Moses has been preached in every city for generations, and is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.  
Then the apostles and elders, along with the whole church, decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; specifically, Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.  
They wrote a letter to them, which said: "The apostles, elders, and brethren send greetings to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.  
We have heard that some men from our group have troubled you with their teachings and unsettled your minds, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' although we did not authorize them.  
It seemed good to us, being of one mind, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Therefore, we are sending Judas and Silas, who will also convey the same message verbally.  
For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential requirements:  
You are to abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell."  
So when they were dismissed, they went to Antioch, where they gathered the congregation and delivered the letter.  
When the people read it, they rejoiced at its encouragement.  
Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them.  
After spending some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to the apostles.  
However, it pleased Silas to remain there.  
Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.  
Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit our brethren in every city where we preached the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."  
Barnabas wanted to take John, also known as Mark, with them.  
But Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.  
Their disagreement became so sharp that they parted ways; Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,  
while Paul chose Silas and departed, commended by the brethren to the grace of God.  
He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
