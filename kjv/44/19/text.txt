And it came to pass that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, having traveled through the upper regions, arrived in Ephesus and found certain disciples there.  
He asked them, "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" They replied, "We have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit."  
He then asked them, "Into what then were you baptized?" They answered, "Into John's baptism."  
Paul explained, "John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."  
Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.  
There were about twelve men in total.  
He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, debating and persuading about the kingdom of God.  
But when some became hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them and took the disciples with him, teaching daily in the school of Tyrannus.  
This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  
God performed extraordinary miracles through Paul,  
so that handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured, and evil spirits left them.  
Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists attempted to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."  
There were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.  
The evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"  
Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  
This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  
Many who believed came forward, confessed, and disclosed their deeds.  
Many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in front of everyone; they counted the value of the books and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.  
So the word of God grew mightily and prevailed.  
After these events, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."  
He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, but he himself stayed in Asia for a while.  
At that time, there arose a significant disturbance concerning the Way.  
A certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines for Diana, brought in considerable profit for the craftsmen.  
He gathered the workers in similar trades and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this business.  
And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.  
So not only is our trade in danger of losing its reputation, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised, and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship."  
When they heard this, they were filled with rage and cried out, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"  
The whole city was filled with confusion, and they seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men from Macedonia who were Paul's traveling companions, and rushed into the theater with one accord.  
When Paul wanted to enter the crowd, the disciples would not allow him.  
Some of the chief officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater.  
Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not even know why they had come together.  
They pushed Alexander forward from the crowd, and the Jews put him forward. Alexander motioned for silence and wanted to make a defense before the people.  
But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"  
Finally, the city clerk quieted the crowd and said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana and of the image that fell from Jupiter?  
Since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.  
For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.  
If Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.  
But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in a lawful assembly.  
For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no reason we can give to justify this commotion."  
After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
