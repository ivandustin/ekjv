Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:  
Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ:  
Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love:  
Having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,  
To the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved.  
In Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace;  
In which He has abounded toward us in all wisdom and insight;  
Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself:  
That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth; even in Him:  
In Him, we have also obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His own will:  
That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ.  
In whom you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom, after you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,  
Which is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.  
Therefore, I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,  
Do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;  
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him:  
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,  
And what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power,  
Which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,  
Far above all principality, power, might, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come:  
And He put all things under His feet and gave Him to be the head over all things to the church,  
Which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
