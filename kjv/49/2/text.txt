You have been made alive, who were once dead in your trespasses and sins;  
In the past, you walked according to the ways of this world, following the ruler of the air, the spirit now at work in those who are disobedient;  
Among whom we all once lived in the desires of our flesh, indulging the cravings of our flesh and mind; and by nature, we were children of wrath, just like the others.  
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love for us,  
Even when we were dead in our sins, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved);  
And raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus;  
So that in the coming ages, He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  
For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not from yourselves: it is the gift of God;  
Not by works, so that no one can boast.  
For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.  
Therefore, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh, called the Uncircumcision by those who are called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands;  
At that time, you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world;  
But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.  
For He is our peace, who has made both groups one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility;  
By abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments and regulations; so as to create in Himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace;  
And to reconcile both to God in one body through the cross, by which He put to death their hostility.  
He came and preached peace to you who were far away and to those who were near.  
For through Him, we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.  
Consequently, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God;  
And you are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone;  
In Him, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord;  
And in Him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by the Spirit.
