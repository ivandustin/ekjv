To the beloved Gaius, whom I cherish in the truth, I write as an elder.
Dear friend, I wish for you to prosper in all things and be in good health, just as your soul is thriving.
I was filled with joy when the brethren came and testified to the truth that resides in you, as you continue to walk in that truth.
There is no greater joy for me than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
Dear friend, you are doing faithfully in all your actions towards the brethren and even to strangers;
They have testified to your love before the church. If you support them on their journey in a godly manner, you will do well.
For they went out for the sake of His name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
Therefore, we ought to welcome such individuals, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not welcome us.
If I come, I will remember his actions, which he does by speaking against us with malicious words. Not only is he not satisfied with that, but he also does not receive the brethren and forbids those who would, casting them out of the church.
Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has a good reputation from everyone, and from the truth itself; we also testify to this, and you know that our testimony is true.
I had many things to write, but I will refrain from writing with ink and pen.
I trust that I will see you soon, and we will speak face to face. Peace be with you. Our friends send their greetings. Greet each friend by name.
