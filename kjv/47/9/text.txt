Regarding the assistance to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you:
For I am aware of your eagerness, which I proudly share with the people of Macedonia, that Achaia was prepared a year ago; and your enthusiasm has inspired many.
Yet I have sent the brothers ahead, so that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this matter; that, as I mentioned, you may be prepared:
In case the people from Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you) would be embarrassed by this same confident boasting.
Therefore, I deemed it necessary to encourage the brothers to go ahead of you and prepare your generous gift, of which you were informed earlier, so that it may be ready, as a matter of generosity, and not as a result of reluctance.
But I say this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and the one who sows generously will also reap generously.
Each person should give as they have decided in their heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to make all grace overflow to you, so that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may excel in every good work:
(As it is written, "He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.")
Now he who supplies seed to the sower will also provide bread for your food, and will multiply your seed sown, and increase the harvest of your righteousness;
Being enriched in every way for all generosity, which results in thanksgiving to God through us.
For the service of this ministry not only meets the needs of the saints but also overflows in many thanksgivings to God;
While through the proof of this ministry they glorify God for your obedience to the gospel of Christ, and for your generous sharing with them and with all people;
And by their prayers for you, who long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
