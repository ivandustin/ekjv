Moreover, brethren, we want you to know about the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia.  
In the midst of a great trial of affliction, their joy overflowed, and despite their deep poverty, they exhibited remarkable generosity.  
I can testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own accord.  
They earnestly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.  
And they did this not as we expected, but first gave themselves to the Lord and then to us, in accordance with God's will.  
So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring to completion this act of grace in you as well.  
Therefore, just as you excel in everything—in faith, speech, knowledge, diligence, and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.  
I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.  
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.  
And here is my advice: It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago, not only to desire to do it but also to complete it.  
Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.  
For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.  
I do not mean that others should be relieved while you are burdened,  
but there should be equality. At the present time, your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality.  
As it is written: "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little."  
Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.  
For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.  
And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.  
And not only that, but he was also chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord and show our eagerness to help.  
We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.  
For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.  
We are sending with them our brother, who has often proved to be diligent in many matters, but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you.  
If anyone asks about Titus, he is my partner and co-worker in your service; and as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.  
Therefore, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
