We, as co-workers with Him, urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
(For He says, "I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.")
We give no offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be blamed.
But in all things, we commend ourselves as ministers of God, with much patience, in afflictions, in needs, in distresses,
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
By purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, yet true;
As unknown, yet well-known; as dying, yet behold, we live; as chastened, yet not killed;
As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
O Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is wide.
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.
Now for the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be also enlarged.
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion has light with darkness?
And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?
And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
