This is the third time I am reaching out to you. In the presence of two or three witnesses, every word shall be confirmed.
I have warned you before, and I am warning you again, as if I were there for the second time; and now, while I am absent, I write to those who have sinned previously, and to all others, that if I return, I will not hold back.
Since you seek proof of Christ speaking through me, know that He is not weak toward you, but is powerful within you.
For although He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God. We too are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God directed toward you.
Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith; test your own selves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you fail the test?
But I trust that you will recognize that we are not disqualified.
Now I pray to God that you do no wrong; not so that we may appear approved, but so that you may do what is right, even if we are seen as disqualified.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong; and this is our desire, even your restoration.
Therefore, I write these things while absent, so that when I am present, I may not have to be harsh, according to the authority the Lord has given me for building up, not for tearing down.
Finally, brothers and sisters, farewell. Aim for restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints send their greetings to you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
