I have resolved within myself that I will not visit you again in sorrow.  
For if I cause you grief, who then will bring me joy, except for the one who is made sorrowful by me?  
I wrote this to you so that when I arrive, I would not experience sorrow from those I should be able to rejoice with; I have confidence in all of you that my joy is shared by all of you.  
Out of great affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears; not to cause you pain, but to let you know the abundant love I have for you.  
If anyone has caused grief, it is not me he has grieved, but only in part, so as not to burden you all.  
This punishment is sufficient for the individual, which was imposed by many.  
Therefore, you should rather forgive and comfort him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.  
I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.  
I also wrote for this purpose, to know your proof of obedience in all matters.  
To whomever you forgive anything, I also forgive; for if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake that I did so in the presence of Christ.  
So that Satan does not gain an advantage over us; for we are not unaware of his schemes.  
Moreover, when I arrived in Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, a door was opened to me by the Lord,  
I had no peace in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus; so I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.  
Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ and reveals the fragrance of His knowledge through us in every place.  
For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ, among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.  
To the one, we are the fragrance of death leading to death; and to the other, the fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequate for these things?  
For we are not like many who peddle the word of God; but as from sincerity, as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
