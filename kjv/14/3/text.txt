Then Solomon commenced the construction of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the site that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  
He began the building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.  
These are the specifications that Solomon received for the construction of the house of God: the length, measured in cubits according to the first standard, was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.  
The porch at the front of the house was designed to match the width of the house, measuring twenty cubits in length and one hundred and twenty cubits in height; he adorned it inside with pure gold.  
The larger room was paneled with fir wood, which he covered with fine gold, and he decorated it with palm trees and chains.  
He embellished the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold used was from Parvaim.  
He also covered the house, including the beams, posts, walls, and doors, with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.  
He constructed the most holy place, which measured twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width, and he overlaid it with fine gold, totaling six hundred talents.  
The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold, and he covered the upper chambers with gold as well.  
In the most holy place, he crafted two cherubim from carved work and overlaid them with gold.  
The wings of the cherubim were each twenty cubits long: one wing of one cherub measured five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was also five cubits, extending to the wing of the other cherub.  
One wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and its other wing was also five cubits, connecting to the wing of the first cherub.  
The wings of these cherubim extended outward, measuring twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet, facing inward.  
He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and embroidered cherubim on it.  
Additionally, he constructed two pillars in front of the house, each thirty-five cubits high, with a five-cubit chapiter atop each.  
He created chains, similar to those in the oracle, and placed them on the tops of the pillars; he made one hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.  
He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, naming the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.
