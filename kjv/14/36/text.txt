Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem.
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for three months in Jerusalem.
The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and imposed a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold on the land.
The king of Egypt appointed Eliakim, his brother, as king over Judah and Jerusalem, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Necho then took Jehoahaz, his brother, and carried him off to Egypt.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem, doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against him, bound him in chains, and took him to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar also carried off the vessels from the house of the LORD to Babylon and placed them in his temple there.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, along with his abominations and everything found in him, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for three months and ten days in Jerusalem, doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
At the end of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, along with the valuable vessels from the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.
He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.
He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel.
Furthermore, all the chief priests and the people greatly transgressed, following all the abominations of the nations, and polluted the house of the LORD, which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
The LORD God of their ancestors sent messengers to them, rising up early and sending them, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.
But they mocked the messengers of God, despised his words, and mistreated his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, and there was no remedy.
Therefore, he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, showing no compassion for young man or maiden, old man, or the weak; he delivered them all into his hand.
All the vessels of the house of God, both great and small, along with the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king and his princes, were taken to Babylon.
They burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, set all its palaces on fire, and destroyed all its valuable vessels.
Those who escaped from the sword were carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.
This was to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; for as long as it lay desolate, it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing, saying,
Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: "The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who among you of all his people? May the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up."
