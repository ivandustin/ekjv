Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.  
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.  
When the kingdom was established for him, he killed the servants who had murdered his father, the king.  
However, he did not kill their children, following the law written in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "Fathers shall not die for their children, nor shall children die for their fathers; each shall die for their own sin."  
Moreover, Amaziah gathered Judah together and appointed captains over thousands and hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin. He numbered them from twenty years old and above and found three hundred thousand choice men, capable of going to war and handling spear and shield.  
He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.  
But a man of God came to him, saying, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you; for the LORD is not with Israel, specifically with all the children of Ephraim."  
"If you choose to go, be strong for the battle; God will make you fall before the enemy, for God has the power to help and to cast down."  
Amaziah replied to the man of God, "What shall we do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of God answered, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this."  
Then Amaziah separated the army that had come to him from Ephraim, sending them home. Their anger against Judah was greatly kindled, and they returned home in great anger.  
Amaziah strengthened himself, led his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down ten thousand of the children of Seir.  
The other ten thousand that were left alive were taken captive by the children of Judah, who brought them to the top of a rock and cast them down, so that they were all broken in pieces.  
But the soldiers of the army that Amaziah sent back, so they would not go with him to battle, attacked the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Bethhoron, killing three thousand of them and taking much spoil.  
After Amaziah returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them, and burned incense to them.  
Therefore, the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent a prophet to him, saying, "Why have you sought after the gods of the people who could not deliver their own people from your hand?"  
As the prophet spoke with him, the king said, "Are you part of the king's counsel? Forbear; why should you be struck?" The prophet forbear and said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not heeded my counsel."  
Then Amaziah, king of Judah, took advice and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us meet face to face."  
Joash, king of Israel, sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But a wild beast passed by in Lebanon and trampled down the thistle."  
"You say, 'Lo, you have struck down the Edomites,' and your heart lifts you up to boast. Stay at home; why should you meddle to your own hurt, so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"  
But Amaziah would not listen, for it came from God, that He might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of Edom.  
So Joash, king of Israel, went up, and they met face to face, both he and Amaziah, king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.  
Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled, every man to his tent.  
Joash, king of Israel, captured Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, breaking down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.  
He took all the gold and silver, all the vessels found in the house of God with Obed-edom, the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.  
Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.  
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, both the first and the last, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  
After Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, a conspiracy was made against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.  
They brought him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
