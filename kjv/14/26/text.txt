Then all the people of Judah appointed Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, as king in place of his father Amaziah.  
He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king rested with his ancestors.  
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.  
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, following all that his father Amaziah had done.  
He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who had insight into the visions of God; as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.  
He went out and fought against the Philistines, breaking down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, and built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.  
God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabians living in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.  
The Ammonites brought gifts to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the entrance of Egypt, for he greatly strengthened himself.  
Additionally, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, fortifying them.  
He also constructed towers in the desert and dug many wells, for he had much livestock in the lowlands and plains, as well as farmers and vine dressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.  
Moreover, Uzziah had a host of fighting men who went out to war in groups, according to their numbers recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.  
The total number of the leaders of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.  
Under their command was an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred, equipped for battle with great strength to assist the king against the enemy.  
Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slings for all the troops.  
He also made engines in Jerusalem, crafted by skilled men, to be placed on the towers and walls to shoot arrows and large stones. His fame spread widely, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong.  
However, when he became strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; he transgressed against the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.  
Azariah the priest went in after him, accompanied by eighty courageous priests of the LORD.  
They confronted King Uzziah and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed; this will not be honored by the LORD God."  
Then Uzziah became angry, holding a censer in his hand to burn incense; while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the incense altar.  
Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead. They hurried to thrust him out, and he himself hurried to go out because the LORD had struck him.  
King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. His son Jotham was in charge of the king's house, judging the people of the land.  
The rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, were written by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.  
So Uzziah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him with his ancestors in the field of burial that belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." Jotham, his son, reigned in his place.
