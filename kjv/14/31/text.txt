Now that all this was completed, all of Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the images into pieces, cut down the groves, and demolished the high places and altars throughout all of Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had completely destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, each man to his own possession, into their respective cities.

Hezekiah organized the courses of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, assigning each man to his service, with the priests and Levites responsible for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister, give thanks, and praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

He also designated a portion of the king's resources for the burnt offerings, specifically for the morning and evening burnt offerings, as well as for the sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts, in accordance with the law of the LORD.

Furthermore, he instructed the people living in Jerusalem to provide for the priests and Levites, so they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

As soon as the command was made known, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, oil, honey, and all the produce of the field; they also brought in the tithe of everything in great quantities.

Regarding the children of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah, they too brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, as well as the tithe of holy things consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps.

In the third month, they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and completed them in the seventh month.

When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.

Then Hezekiah inquired of the priests and the Levites about the heaps.

Azariah, the chief priest of the house of Zadok, answered him, saying, "Since the people began to bring offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left over; for the LORD has blessed His people, and what remains is this great store."

Then Hezekiah commanded that chambers be prepared in the house of the LORD, and they were made ready.

They brought in the offerings, tithes, and dedicated things faithfully, overseen by Cononiah the Levite, with his brother Shimei assisting him.

Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Cononiah and his brother Shimei, following the command of King Hezekiah and Azariah, the ruler of the house of God.

Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was in charge of the freewill offerings of God, distributing the oblations of the LORD and the most holy things.

Next to him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, fulfilling their designated roles to provide for their brethren by courses, both for the great and the small.

In addition to their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, every one who entered the house of the LORD received his daily portion for their service in their respective duties according to their courses.

This included the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their responsibilities by their courses.

They also maintained the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, sons, and daughters throughout the congregation, as they sanctified themselves in holiness in their designated roles.

Moreover, the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields surrounding their cities, were named specifically to allocate portions to all the males among the priests and to all those counted by genealogies among the Levites.

Thus, Hezekiah acted throughout all Judah, doing what was good, right, and true before the LORD his God.

In every endeavor he undertook in the service of the house of God, and in the law and commandments to seek his God, he did it wholeheartedly and prospered.
