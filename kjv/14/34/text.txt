Josiah was eight years old when he began his reign, and he ruled in Jerusalem for thirty-one years.  
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, following the ways of his father David, and did not turn to the right or the left.  
In the eighth year of his reign, while still young, he began to seek the God of David, his father; and in the twelfth year, he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, groves, carved images, and molten images.  
He broke down the altars of Baal in his presence, cut down the images that were high above them, shattered the groves, carved images, and molten images, turning them to dust and scattering it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.  
He burned the bones of the priests on their altars and purified Judah and Jerusalem.  
He did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, using their tools all around.  
After breaking down the altars and groves, grinding the graven images to powder, and cutting down all the idols throughout Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.  
In the eighteenth year of his reign, after purging the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah, the governor of the city, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.  
When they arrived at Hilkiah, the high priest, they delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the remnant of Israel, as well as from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.  
They entrusted it to the workmen who oversaw the house of the LORD, giving it to those who worked in the house to repair and restore it.  
They provided it to the artisans and builders to purchase hewn stone, timber for couplings, and to floor the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.  
The men worked faithfully, with overseers Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of the Kohathites, to set the work in motion; along with other Levites skilled in musical instruments.  
They also supervised the bearers of burdens and oversaw all who worked in any capacity: among the Levites were scribes, officers, and porters.  
When they brought out the money that had been collected for the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.  
Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." He then gave the book to Shaphan.  
Shaphan took the book to the king and reported back, saying, "All that was committed to your servants, they are doing."  
They have gathered the money found in the house of the LORD and delivered it into the hands of the overseers and the workmen.  
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." Shaphan read it before the king.  
When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.  
The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, a servant of the king, saying,  
"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."  
Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college) and they spoke to her regarding this matter.  
She answered them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,  
'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.  
Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.'  
As for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, you shall say to him, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the words you have heard:  
Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before me, and tore your clothes, and wept before me; I have also heard you, says the LORD.  
Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon its inhabitants.' So they brought the king word again.  
Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.  
The king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.  
The king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, to keep his commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all his heart and soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in this book.  
He caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. The inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.  
Josiah removed all the abominations from all the territories belonging to the children of Israel and made all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign, they did not turn away from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
