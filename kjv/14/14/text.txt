So Abijah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David; Asa, his son, succeeded him as king. During his reign, the land enjoyed peace for ten years.  
Asa did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD his God.  
He removed the altars of foreign gods and the high places, smashed the sacred stones, and cut down the Asherah poles.  
He commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to observe the law and the commandments.  
He also removed the high places and the images from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was at peace before him.  
He fortified the cities of Judah, for the land was at rest, and he experienced no wars during those years because the LORD had granted him peace.  
Therefore, he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates, and bars, while the land is still available to us; for we have sought the LORD our God, and He has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.  
Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah who carried shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin who carried shields and drew bows; all these were valiant warriors.  
Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and he approached Mareshah.  
Asa went out to confront him, and they arranged the battle in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.  
Asa cried out to the LORD his God, saying, "LORD, there is no one like You to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on You, and in Your name, we go against this vast army. O LORD, You are our God; let no mortal prevail against You."  
So the LORD struck down the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.  
Asa and the people with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians were defeated so badly that they could not recover; they were destroyed before the LORD and His army, and they carried away a great deal of plunder.  
They attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them, and they plundered all the cities, for there was a great amount of spoil in them.  
They also struck down the tents of the livestock, taking a large number of sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
