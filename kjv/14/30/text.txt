Hezekiah sent messages to all of Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel.  
The king consulted with his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem to observe the Passover in the second month.  
They were unable to keep it at that time because the priests had not consecrated themselves adequately, and the people had not gathered in Jerusalem.  
This proposal pleased the king and all the assembly.  
They established a decree to proclaim throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, inviting everyone to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem, as it had not been observed in such a manner for a long time.  
The messengers went with the letters from the king and his officials throughout all Israel and Judah, as commanded by the king, saying, "Children of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."  
Do not be like your ancestors and your brothers who rebelled against the LORD God of their fathers, leading to their desolation, as you can see.  
Do not be stubborn like your fathers; yield yourselves to the LORD and enter His sanctuary, which He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God so that His fierce anger may turn away from you.  
If you return to the LORD, your brothers and children will find compassion from those who took them captive, and they will return to this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.  
The messengers traveled from city to city throughout the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but they were met with ridicule and mockery.  
However, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.  
In Judah, the hand of God was upon them, giving them one heart to obey the command of the king and his officials, according to the word of the LORD.  
A large crowd assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, forming a very great congregation.  
They rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, taking away all the incense altars and casting them into the Kidron Valley.  
On the fourteenth day of the second month, they slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests and Levites were ashamed, consecrated themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.  
They stood in their designated places, following the law of Moses, the man of God, while the priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites.  
Since many in the congregation were not consecrated, the Levites were responsible for slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.  
A multitude of people, including many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, even if he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary."  
The LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.  
The children of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.  
Hezekiah spoke kindly to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD, and they ate throughout the feast for seven days, offering peace offerings and confessing to the LORD God of their fathers.  
The entire assembly decided to celebrate for another seven days, and they did so with joy.  
King Hezekiah of Judah provided the congregation with a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, while the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep, and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.  
All the congregation of Judah, along with the priests and Levites, and all those who came from Israel and the foreigners residing in the land, rejoiced.  
There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.  
Then the priests and Levites stood up and blessed the people; their voices were heard, and their prayers ascended to His holy dwelling place, even to heaven.
