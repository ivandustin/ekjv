In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began his reign over Judah.  
He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. There was conflict between Abijah and Jeroboam.  
Abijah arranged his forces with an army of valiant warriors, totaling four hundred thousand chosen men; Jeroboam also organized his troops against him, with eight hundred thousand chosen men, all mighty warriors.  
Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, located in Mount Ephraim, and proclaimed, "Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel;  
Should you not know that the LORD God of Israel granted the kingdom of Israel to David forever, to him and his descendants, by a covenant of salt?  
Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon, the son of David, has risen up and rebelled against his lord.  
He has gathered vain men, the children of Belial, and has strengthened himself against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, unable to resist them.  
And now you think to oppose the kingdom of the LORD in the hands of the sons of David; you are a great multitude, and you have the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.  
Have you not expelled the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and appointed priests for yourselves in the manner of the nations of other lands? So that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of those who are no gods.  
But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; the priests who minister to the LORD are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are dedicated to their duties.  
They offer burnt sacrifices and sweet incense to the LORD every morning and evening; they also arrange the showbread on the pure table and keep the golden lampstand with its lamps burning every evening. We maintain the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him.  
And behold, God Himself is with us as our captain, and His priests are with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.  
But Jeroboam set an ambush behind them: they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.  
When Judah looked back, they saw the battle was in front and behind them; they cried out to the LORD, and the priests sounded the trumpets.  
Then the men of Judah shouted, and as they shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.  
The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.  
Abijah and his people struck them down with a great slaughter, and five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell slain.  
Thus, at that time, the children of Israel were subdued, and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers.  
Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured cities from him, including Bethel and its towns, Jeshanah and its towns, and Ephraim and its towns.  
Jeroboam did not regain strength during Abijah's reign; the LORD struck him, and he died.  
But Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.  
The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are recorded in the story of the prophet Iddo.
