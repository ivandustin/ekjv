And Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his kingdom; the LORD his God was with him and greatly magnified him.  
Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and hundreds, to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the leaders of the families.  
So Solomon, along with the entire congregation, went to the high place at Gibeon, for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, had made in the wilderness.  
However, David had brought the ark of God up from Kirjath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, having pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.  
Additionally, the bronze altar that Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was placed before the tabernacle of the LORD, and Solomon and the congregation sought guidance from it.  
And Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.  
That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."  
And Solomon replied to God, "You have shown great mercy to David my father and have made me reign in his place."  
Now, O LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.  
Give me wisdom and knowledge now, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?  
And God said to Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for riches, wealth, or honor, nor for the life of your enemies, nor have you asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people over whom I have made you king:  
Wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings before you have had, nor shall any after you have the like."  
Then Solomon returned from his journey to the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.  
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.  
The king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as plentiful as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamore trees in the lowland.  
And Solomon imported horses from Egypt and linen yarn; the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.  
They brought up a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty; and they exported horses for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria through their agents.
