Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah from Beersheba.  
Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD throughout the days of Jehoiada the priest.  
Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.  
After this, Joash decided to repair the house of the LORD.  
He gathered the priests and the Levites and instructed them to go out to the cities of Judah to collect money from all Israel for the repair of the house of your God year after year, urging them to expedite the matter. However, the Levites did not act quickly.  
The king summoned Jehoiada the chief and asked him why he had not required the Levites to bring in the collection from Judah and Jerusalem, as commanded by Moses the servant of the LORD and the congregation of Israel for the tabernacle of witness.  
The sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and they had also given all the dedicated items of the house of the LORD to Baalim.  
At the king's command, they made a chest and placed it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.  
They proclaimed throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in the collection to the LORD that Moses the servant of God had laid upon Israel in the wilderness.  
All the princes and the people rejoiced, brought in their contributions, and cast them into the chest until they had finished.  
It happened that when the chest was brought to the king's office by the Levites, and they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came, emptied the chest, took it, and returned it to its place. They did this daily, gathering money in abundance.  
The king and Jehoiada gave the collected funds to those who were doing the work of the service of the house of the LORD, hiring masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, as well as those who worked with iron and brass to mend it.  
The workmen worked diligently, and the project was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original state and strengthened it.  
When they finished, they brought the remaining money before the king and Jehoiada, from which they made vessels for the house of the LORD, including items for ministry, offerings, spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually throughout the days of Jehoiada.  
However, Jehoiada grew old and full of days when he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death.  
They buried him in the city of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward His house.  
After the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king. The king listened to them.  
They abandoned the house of the LORD God of their fathers and served groves and idols, leading to wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem for this transgression.  
Yet he sent prophets to bring them back to the LORD; they testified against them, but they would not listen.  
The Spirit of God came upon Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people and said to them, "Thus says God, Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has also forsaken you."  
They conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the king's command in the court of the house of the LORD.  
Thus, Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada his father had shown him, but instead killed his son. As he died, he said, "The LORD look upon it and require it."  
At the end of the year, the army of Syria came against him; they invaded Judah and Jerusalem, destroying all the princes of the people and sending all the spoils to the king of Damascus.  
The army of the Syrians came with a small number of men, but the LORD delivered a very great host into their hands because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. Thus, they executed judgment against Joash.  
When they departed from him (for they left him in great illness), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and killed him in his bed. He died and was buried in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.  
These are the conspirators against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, a Moabitess.  
Now concerning his sons, the burdens laid upon him, and the repair of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. Amaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
