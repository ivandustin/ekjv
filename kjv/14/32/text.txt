After these events and their establishment, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, arrived and entered Judah, encamping against the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself.  
When Hezekiah learned that Sennacherib had come and was determined to attack Jerusalem,  
he consulted with his officials and valiant men to stop the water supply from the springs outside the city, and they assisted him.  
A large crowd gathered to stop all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, asking, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?"  
He also strengthened himself, repairing all the broken walls, raising them up to the towers, constructing another wall outside, and restoring Millo in the city of David, while making numerous darts and shields.  
He appointed military leaders over the people, gathering them in the street at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,  
"Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or dismayed by the king of Assyria or his vast army, for there are more with us than with him.  
He has only the strength of flesh, but we have the LORD our God to help us and fight our battles." The people found comfort in the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.  
After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (while he himself besieged Lachish with all his forces) to Hezekiah, king of Judah, and to all the people in Jerusalem, saying,  
"Thus says Sennacherib, king of Assyria: On what are you relying that you remain besieged in Jerusalem?  
Isn't Hezekiah misleading you to surrender and die of hunger and thirst, claiming, 'The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria'?  
Hasn't the same Hezekiah removed his high places and altars, commanding Judah and Jerusalem to worship before one altar and burn incense on it?  
Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of those nations able to rescue their lands from my hand?  
Which of all the gods of those nations that my ancestors destroyed could save their people from my hand? How then can your God deliver you from my hand?  
So do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you in this way; do not believe him. No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people from my hand or the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?"  
His servants spoke even more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.  
He also wrote letters to insult the LORD God of Israel and to speak against Him, saying, "Just as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand."  
Then they shouted loudly in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and disturb them, so they might capture the city.  
They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of human hands.  
For this reason, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven.  
The LORD sent an angel who cut down all the mighty warriors, leaders, and commanders in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned home in disgrace. When he entered the temple of his god, his own sons killed him there with the sword.  
Thus, the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and from all others, guiding them on every side.  
Many brought gifts to the LORD in Jerusalem and presents to Hezekiah, king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.  
In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, and the LORD spoke to him, giving him a sign.  
However, Hezekiah did not repay the kindness shown to him, for his heart was proud; therefore, the LORD's wrath was upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.  
Nevertheless, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's days.  
Hezekiah amassed great wealth and honor, making treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable items.  
He also built storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil, and stables for all kinds of livestock and pens for flocks.  
Moreover, he provided cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very much wealth.  
This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper water source of Gihon and brought it directly down to the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his endeavors.  
However, when the ambassadors from the princes of Babylon came to inquire about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him, so that he might know all that was in his heart.  
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.  
Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in the most prestigious tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death, and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
