The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the group of men who had come with the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons. Thus, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he ascended to the throne, and he ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.
He followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his advisor in doing evil.
As a result, he committed wicked acts in the sight of the LORD, similar to the house of Ahab, for they counseled him after his father's death, leading to his downfall.
He also followed their advice and joined Jehoram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, in battle against Hazael, king of Syria, at Ramoth-gilead, where the Syrians struck Joram.
He returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he sustained at Ramah while fighting Hazael, king of Syria. Azariah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to visit Jehoram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel because he was ill.
The downfall of Ahaziah was orchestrated by God when he allied with Joram, for upon his arrival, he went out with Jehoram to confront Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to eliminate the house of Ahab.
It came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the brothers of Ahaziah who served him, and he killed them.
He sought out Ahaziah, and they captured him (for he was hiding in Samaria) and brought him to Jehu. After they killed him, they buried him, saying, "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." Thus, the house of Ahaziah was unable to maintain control of the kingdom.
When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, realized her son was dead, she rose up and exterminated all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.
However, Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and hid him from among the slain king's sons, placing him and his nurse in a secret chamber. Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest (and sister of Ahaziah), concealed him from Athaliah so that she would not kill him.
He remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah ruled over the land.
