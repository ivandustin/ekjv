And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Oded.  
He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you as long as you are with Him; if you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you."  
For a long time, Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without the law.  
But when they turned to the LORD God of Israel in their trouble and sought Him, He was found by them.  
During those times, there was no peace for those who went out or came in, but great distress was upon all the inhabitants of the lands.  
Nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with all kinds of adversity.  
Be strong, therefore, and do not let your hands be weak, for your work will be rewarded.  
When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities he had captured in Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD that was before the porch of the LORD.  
He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, along with the strangers from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they had joined him in abundance when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.  
So they assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.  
They offered to the LORD at that time from the spoils they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.  
They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and soul;  
That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.  
They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, and with trumpets and cornets.  
All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.  
Regarding Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove; Asa cut down her idol, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron.  
However, the high places were not removed from Israel; nevertheless, Asa's heart was perfect all his days.  
He brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, as well as those he himself had dedicated: silver, gold, and vessels.  
There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
