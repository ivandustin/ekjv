In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds: Azariah, the son of Jeroham; Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan; Azariah, the son of Obed; Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah; and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri, into a covenant with him.  
They traveled throughout Judah, gathering the Levites from all the cities of Judah, along with the leaders of the families of Israel, and they assembled in Jerusalem.  
The entire congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. He said to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has declared concerning the sons of David."  
This is what you shall do: A third of you, who enter on the Sabbath, of the priests and Levites, shall be gatekeepers at the doors;  
A third shall be at the king's house, and a third at the gate of the foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.  
But let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and those Levites who minister; they may enter, for they are holy. All the people shall keep watch over the LORD.  
The Levites shall surround the king, each man with his weapon in hand. Anyone else who enters the house shall be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.  
So the Levites and all Judah acted according to everything that Jehoiada the priest commanded, taking each man his assigned duty for the Sabbath, as Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.  
Moreover, Jehoiada the priest provided the captains of hundreds with spears, bucklers, and shields that had belonged to King David, which were kept in the house of God.  
He positioned all the people, each man with his weapon in hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side, alongside the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.  
Then they brought out the king's son, placed the crown upon him, gave him the testimony, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, proclaiming, "God save the king!"  
When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people in the house of the LORD.  
She looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, with the princes and the trumpeters beside him. All the people of the land rejoiced and sounded trumpets, while the singers played instruments of music and taught the people to sing praises. Athaliah then tore her clothes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"  
Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were in charge of the army and said to them, "Take her outside the ranks, and whoever follows her should be slain with the sword." For the priest commanded, "Do not slay her in the house of the LORD."  
So they seized her, and when she reached the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they killed her there.  
Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they would be the LORD's people.  
Then all the people went to the house of Baal, tore it down, smashed its altars and images to pieces, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars.  
Jehoiada also appointed the duties of the house of the LORD through the priests and Levites, whom David had assigned in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as prescribed in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as ordained by David.  
He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, so that no one unclean in any way could enter.  
He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD. They came through the high gate into the king's house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.  
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
