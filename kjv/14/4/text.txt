Moreover, he constructed an altar of brass, measuring twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in breadth, and ten cubits in height.
He also created a molten sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, round in circumference, and five cubits in height; a line of thirty cubits encircled it.
Beneath it was the likeness of oxen, which surrounded it: ten in a cubit, encircling the sea. Two rows of oxen were cast during its creation.
It rested upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was positioned above them, with all their hind parts inward.
Its thickness was a handbreadth, and the brim resembled the work of a cup, adorned with lily flowers; it received and held three thousand baths.
He also made ten lavers, placing five on the right side and five on the left for washing; the offerings for the burnt offering were washed in them, while the sea was designated for the priests to wash in.
He crafted ten candlesticks of gold according to their design and positioned them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
Additionally, he made ten tables and arranged them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left, and he created one hundred basins of gold.
Furthermore, he constructed the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, overlaying the doors with brass.
He placed the sea on the right side of the east end, opposite the south.
Huram made the pots, shovels, and basins, completing the work he was assigned for King Solomon for the house of God;
Specifically, the two pillars, the pommels, and the chapiters atop the two pillars, along with the two wreaths to cover the pommels of the chapiters on the pillars;
And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths, with two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the pommels of the chapiters on the pillars.
He also made bases and lavers upon the bases;
One sea, supported by twelve oxen beneath it.
The pots, shovels, fleshhooks, and all their instruments were crafted by Huram, his father, for King Solomon for the house of the LORD from bright brass.
In the plain of Jordan, the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
Thus, Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, as the weight of the brass could not be determined.
Solomon also made all the vessels for the house of God, including the golden altar and the tables for the showbread;
Moreover, the candlesticks with their lamps were made to burn in the manner before the oracle, crafted from pure gold;
He made the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold, all of perfect quality;
And the snuffers, basins, spoons, and censers were made of pure gold; the entry of the house, the inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the temple were also made of gold.
