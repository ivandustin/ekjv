When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 chosen warriors from the house of Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel, intending to restore the kingdom to himself.
However, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, a man of God, instructing him to say,
"Speak to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
'Thus says the LORD: You shall not go up or fight against your brothers. Let every man return to his home, for this matter is ordained by Me.'" They obeyed the LORD's command and withdrew from confronting Jeroboam.
Rehoboam settled in Jerusalem and fortified cities in Judah.
He built cities such as Bethlehem, Etam, and Tekoa,
as well as Bethzur, Shoco, and Adullam,
Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph,
Adoraim, Lachish, and Azekah,
Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
He strengthened the strongholds, appointed captains, and stored provisions, oil, and wine.
In every city, he placed shields and spears, making them exceedingly strong, with Judah and Benjamin on his side.
The priests and Levites from all Israel gathered to him from their regions.
The Levites abandoned their towns and possessions to come to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had removed them from serving as priests to the LORD.
He appointed priests for the high places, for the idols, and for the calves he had made.
Afterward, those from all the tribes of Israel who were determined to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD God of their ancestors.
Thus, they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, son of Solomon, strong for three years, during which they followed the ways of David and Solomon.
Rehoboam married Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse;
she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham.
After her, he took Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
Rehoboam loved Maachah, daughter of Absalom, more than all his other wives and concubines; he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
Rehoboam made Abijah, son of Maachah, chief among his brothers, intending to make him king.
He acted wisely, distributing his children throughout all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city, providing them with abundant provisions. He also desired many wives.
