Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all of Israel had gathered there to make him king.  
When Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had fled to Egypt to escape King Solomon, heard this, he returned from Egypt.  
They sent for him, and Jeroboam along with all of Israel spoke to Rehoboam, saying,  
"Your father made our yoke burdensome; now, lighten the harsh servitude your father imposed on us, and we will serve you."  
Rehoboam replied, "Come back to me in three days." So the people departed.  
King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, asking, "What advice do you give me to respond to this people?"  
They advised him, "If you are kind to this people, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever."  
However, he rejected the advice of the elders and sought counsel from the young men who had grown up with him and were now in his service.  
He asked them, "What do you advise that we should say to this people who have requested that I lighten the yoke my father placed on them?"  
The young men replied, "This is what you should tell the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should lighten it for us': say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.  
Whereas my father laid a heavy yoke on you, I will make it even heavier; my father used whips on you, but I will use scorpions.'"  
So Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed.  
The king responded harshly and disregarded the advice of the elders,  
answering them according to the counsel of the young men: "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father used whips on you, but I will use scorpions."  
The king did not listen to the people, for the situation was from God, so that the LORD could fulfill His word spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat.  
When all of Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king, saying, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you, to your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, David." So all of Israel went to their tents.  
But the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah were ruled by Rehoboam.  
Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.  
Thus, Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.
