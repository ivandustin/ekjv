And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel followed him.
And it came to pass that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem because they had transgressed against the LORD.
With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen, and the people who came with him out of Egypt were without number; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah and came to Jerusalem.
Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, "Thus says the LORD: You have forsaken me, and therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak."
Upon hearing this, the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves, saying, "The LORD is righteous."
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."
Nevertheless, they shall be his servants, so that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made.
In their place, King Rehoboam made shields of brass and entrusted them to the chief of the guard, who kept watch at the entrance of the king's house.
And when the king entered the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched the shields, bringing them back to the guard chamber.
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so that he would not destroy him completely; and also, things went well in Judah.
So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
And he did evil, for he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, both the first and the last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah reigned in his stead.
