When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions, accompanied by a large entourage and camels laden with spices, abundant gold, and precious stones. Upon her arrival, she spoke with Solomon about everything that was on her mind.
Solomon answered all her questions, leaving nothing undisclosed.
After witnessing Solomon's wisdom and the magnificent house he had built,
along with the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their attire, the apparel of his cupbearers, and the way he ascended to the house of the LORD, she was left breathless.
She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own land about your deeds and wisdom was true.
However, I did not believe their words until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Indeed, the half of your greatness and wisdom was not told to me; you surpass the fame I had heard."
"Blessed are your men, and blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom.
Praise be to the LORD your God, who delighted in you and set you on His throne as king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel and established them forever, He made you king over them to maintain justice and righteousness."
She presented the king with one hundred and twenty talents of gold, a great abundance of spices, and precious stones; there had never been such spices as those given to King Solomon by the queen of Sheba.
The servants of Huram and Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.
The king used the algum trees to make terraces for the house of the LORD and for the king's palace, as well as harps and psalteries for singers; such items had never been seen before in the land of Judah.
King Solomon granted the queen of Sheba all her desires, whatever she asked, in addition to what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and returned to her own land with her servants.
The amount of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
not including what the merchants and traders brought. All the kings of Arabia and governors of the region brought gold and silver to Solomon.
King Solomon made two hundred gold shields, each shield requiring six hundred shekels of beaten gold.
He also made three hundred gold shields, each shield requiring three hundred shekels of gold, and placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
Additionally, the king constructed a grand throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
The throne had six steps, with a gold footstool attached, and there were armrests on each side of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests.
Twelve lions stood on either side of the six steps; nothing like it had been made in any kingdom.
All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were made of gold, and all the vessels in the house of the forest of Lebanon were pure gold; silver was not valued in the days of Solomon.
The king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram, and every three years, the ships from Tarshish returned, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.
All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had placed in his heart.
They each brought gifts: vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, harnesses, spices, horses, and mules, each year in their appointed season.
Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
He ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
The king made silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as sycamore trees in the lowlands.
They brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all other lands.
Now, the rest of Solomon's acts, both the first and the last, are they not recorded in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
Solomon rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David; his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
