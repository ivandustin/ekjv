Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem; however, he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his father David had done.
He followed the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten images for Baalim.
Furthermore, he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire, following the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the children of Israel.
He also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
As a result, the LORD his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Syria, who struck him and carried away a great multitude of captives to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted a great slaughter upon him.
For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed one hundred and twenty thousand valiant men in Judah in a single day because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the king's son, Azrikam, the governor of the house, and Elkanah, who was next to the king.
The children of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their brethren, including women, sons, and daughters, and they also took a large amount of spoil from them, bringing the spoil to Samaria.
But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there; he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven."
"And now you plan to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as bondmen and bondwomen for yourselves; but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?"
"Now hear me, and return the captives you have taken from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."
Then certain leaders of the children of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—stood up against those who had come from the war.
They said to them, "You shall not bring the captives here, for we have already offended against the LORD, and you intend to add more to our sins and to our guilt, for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
The men who were designated by name rose up, took the captives, clothed all the naked among them, arrayed them, shod them, gave them food and drink, anointed them, and carried all the weak among them on donkeys, bringing them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren; then they returned to Samaria.
At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
For the Edomites had again come and struck Judah, carrying away captives.
The Philistines also invaded the cities of the low country and the south of Judah, taking Bethshemesh, Ajalon, Gederoth, Shocho with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there.
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had made Judah naked and had greatly transgressed against the LORD.
And Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came to him and distressed him, but did not strengthen him.
For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD, from the house of the king, and from the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.
In his time of distress, he further transgressed against the LORD; this is that King Ahaz.
For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had struck him, and he said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, shut the doors of the house of the LORD, and made altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
In every city of Judah, he made high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking the LORD God of his fathers to anger.
Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, both first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
