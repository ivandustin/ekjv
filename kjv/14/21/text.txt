Now Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was laid to rest alongside them in the city of David. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king.  
He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.  
Their father bestowed upon them significant gifts of silver, gold, and precious items, along with fortified cities in Judah; however, the kingdom was given to Jehoram, as he was the firstborn.  
When Jehoram ascended to the throne of his father, he fortified his position and killed all his brothers with the sword, along with various princes of Israel.  
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for eight years in Jerusalem.  
He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did, for he had married Ahab's daughter; he committed evil in the sight of the LORD.  
Nevertheless, the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant He made with David, and as He promised to provide a light for him and his descendants forever.  
During his reign, the Edomites revolted against the rule of Judah and established their own king.  
Then Jehoram went out with his princes and all his chariots; he rose up at night and struck down the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.  
Thus, the Edomites revolted from under the authority of Judah to this day. At the same time, Libnah also revolted against him because he had forsaken the LORD God of his ancestors.  
Moreover, he built high places in the mountains of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into sexual immorality, compelling Judah to do the same.  
A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, stating, "Thus says the LORD God of David your father: Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,  
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit acts of harlotry, like the harlotries of the house of Ahab, and have also killed your brothers of your father's house, who were better than you:  
Behold, the LORD will strike your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions with a great plague.  
And you will suffer severe illness from a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness day by day.  
Furthermore, the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians, who were near the Ethiopians.  
They came up into Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king's house, including his sons and wives; so that no son remained with him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.  
After all this, the LORD afflicted him in his bowels with an incurable disease.  
Eventually, after two years, his bowels fell out due to his sickness, and he died from severe diseases. His people did not burn incense for him, as they had for his ancestors.  
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years, departing without being desired. However, they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
