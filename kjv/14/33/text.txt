Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.  
However, he committed evil in the sight of the LORD, similar to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the children of Israel.  
He restored the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, erected altars for Baalim, made groves, worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.  
Additionally, he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had declared, "In Jerusalem, my name shall be forever."  
He constructed altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.  
He caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; he practiced divination, used enchantments, engaged in witchcraft, consulted familiar spirits, and dealt with wizards. He committed much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.  
He set a carved image, the idol he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and Solomon, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen above all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever."  
"I will no longer remove the foot of Israel from the land I appointed for your ancestors, provided they are careful to do all that I commanded them, according to the whole law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses."  
Thus, Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, causing them to act worse than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.  
The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they did not listen.  
Therefore, the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh among the thorns, bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.  
When he was in distress, he sought the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors.  
He prayed to Him, and God was moved by his plea, heard his supplication, and restored him to Jerusalem and his kingdom. Then Manasseh realized that the LORD was God.  
After this, he built a wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, extending to the entrance of the Fish Gate, surrounding Ophel, raising it to a great height, and appointed captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.  
He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, along with all the altars he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.  
He repaired the altar of the LORD, offered peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.  
Nevertheless, the people continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.  
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, are written in the book of the kings of Israel.  
His prayer, how God was moved by him, all his sins, his transgressions, and the places where he built high places and set up groves and carved images before he humbled himself, are recorded among the sayings of the seers.  
So Manasseh rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in his own house; his son Amon succeeded him as king.  
Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for two years in Jerusalem.  
He committed evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done; Amon sacrificed to all the carved images that Manasseh had made and served them.  
He did not humble himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; instead, Amon became increasingly unfaithful.  
His servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house.  
But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
