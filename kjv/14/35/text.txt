Moreover, Josiah celebrated a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they sacrificed the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month.  
He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.  
He instructed the Levites, who taught all Israel and were consecrated to the LORD, to place the holy ark in the temple that Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, had built; it should not be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.  
Prepare yourselves by the houses of your ancestors, according to your divisions, as prescribed in the writings of David, king of Israel, and Solomon, his son.  
Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of your fellow Israelites and the divisions of the families of the Levites.  
So, sacrifice the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and prepare your fellow Israelites to do according to the word of the LORD as commanded by Moses.  
Josiah provided the people with lambs and kids from the flock for the Passover offerings, totaling thirty thousand lambs and three thousand bullocks; these were from the king's own possessions.  
His officials willingly contributed to the people, the priests, and the Levites: Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave the priests two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen for the Passover offerings.  
Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethaneel, his brothers, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, chief Levites, provided five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen for the Levites' Passover offerings.  
Thus, the service was prepared, and the priests took their positions, and the Levites stood in their divisions, as commanded by the king.  
They sacrificed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, while the Levites prepared the lambs.  
They removed the burnt offerings to distribute them according to the divisions of the families of the people, offering them to the LORD, as written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the oxen.  
They roasted the Passover lambs over the fire according to the ordinance, while the other holy offerings were boiled in pots, cauldrons, and pans, and quickly distributed among all the people.  
Afterward, they prepared for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy offering burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.  
The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, as commanded by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer; and the gatekeepers stood at every gate, not departing from their service, for their fellow Levites prepared for them.  
So, all the service of the LORD was prepared that day to celebrate the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as commanded by King Josiah.  
The children of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.  
There had been no Passover like that celebrated in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel kept such a Passover as Josiah did, along with the priests, Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign.  
After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, King Necho of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him.  
But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, "What do I have to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house I am at war with; for God has commanded me to make haste. Do not meddle with God, who is with me, or He will destroy you."  
Nevertheless, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to fight him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and went to battle in the valley of Megiddo.  
The archers shot at King Josiah, and he said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am severely wounded."  
His servants took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot he had; they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died and was buried in one of the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.  
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and women spoke of him in their lamentations to this day, making it an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the lamentations.  
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to what is written in the law of the LORD,  
And his deeds, both the first and the last, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
