And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,  
That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon were built by him, and he settled the children of Israel there.  
And Solomon went to Hamathzobah and successfully conquered it.  
He constructed Tadmor in the wilderness, along with all the store cities he built in Hamath.  
Additionally, he built the upper and lower Bethhoron, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars;  
And Baalath, along with all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, as well as the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon wished to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout all the land under his rule.  
As for all the people who remained from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel,  
The children of Israel did not consume their descendants who remained in the land; instead, Solomon made them pay tribute until this day.  
However, Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel his servants for his work; they were men of war, chief captains, and commanders of his chariots and horsemen.  
These were the chief officers of King Solomon, numbering two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.  
Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house he had built for her, stating, "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, because the places are holy, where the ark of the LORD has come."  
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar he had built before the porch,  
Daily offering at a specified rate, according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, new moons, and solemn feasts, three times a year: during the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles.  
He appointed, according to the order of his father David, the courses of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties, to praise and minister before the priests as required daily; the porters also by their courses at every gate, as commanded by David, the man of God.  
They did not depart from the commandment of the king regarding the priests and Levites concerning any matter or the treasures.  
Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD until it was completed. Thus, the house of the LORD was perfected.  
Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and Eloth, by the seaside in the land of Edom.  
Huram sent him ships and skilled sailors by the hands of his servants; they went with Solomon's servants to Ophir, where they took four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
