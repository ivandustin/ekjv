Thus, all the work that Solomon completed for the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon brought in all the items that his father David had dedicated, including the silver, gold, and all the instruments, and placed them among the treasures of the house of God.
Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, along with all the heads of the tribes and the leaders of the families of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion.
Therefore, all the men of Israel assembled before the king for the feast that took place in the seventh month.
All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites carried the ark.
They brought up the ark, the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; these were brought up by the priests and the Levites.
King Solomon, along with the entire congregation of Israel that had gathered before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be counted or numbered due to their multitude.
The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its designated place, to the oracle of the house, in the most holy place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, covering the ark and its poles from above.
They drew out the poles of the ark so that the ends of the poles were visible from the ark in front of the oracle, but they were not visible outside. And it remains that way to this day.
There was nothing in the ark except for the two tablets that Moses placed inside at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel as they came out of Egypt.
When the priests came out of the holy place, (for all the priests present had been sanctified and did not wait by course),
The Levites, who were the singers, all from Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, along with their sons and brothers, dressed in white linen and carrying cymbals, psalteries, and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, accompanied by one hundred and twenty priests sounding trumpets.
It came to pass that as the trumpeters and singers united to make one sound in praising and thanking the LORD, and when they lifted their voices with trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, praising the LORD and saying, "For He is good; for His mercy endures forever," the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD.
So much so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
