Where do wars and conflicts among you originate? Do they not arise from your desires that battle within you?  
You desire, yet do not have; you kill and covet, but cannot obtain; you fight and quarrel, yet you do not have because you do not ask.  
You ask, but do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, seeking to spend it on your pleasures.  
You adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.  
Do you think the Scripture speaks without purpose when it says, "The spirit that dwells in us yearns to envy"?  
But He gives us more grace. That is why it says, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."  
Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  
Come near to God, and He will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  
Grieve, mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.  
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up.  
Do not speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters. The one who speaks against a brother or judges a brother speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.  
There is only one Lawgiver, who is able to save and destroy. Who are you to judge another?  
Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make money."  
You do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  
Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that."  
As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.  
So if anyone knows the good they ought to do and doesnâ€™t do it, it is sin for them.
