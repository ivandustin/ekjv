Go now, you wealthy individuals, weep and lament for the miseries that are about to come upon you.  
Your riches have decayed, and your garments are infested with moths.  
Your gold and silver have rusted; their corrosion will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. You have amassed treasures for the final days.  
Look, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which you have withheld through deceit, cry out; and the cries of those who harvested have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.  
You have indulged in luxury on earth and lived in excess; you have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.  
You have condemned and murdered the innocent, and he does not resist you.  
Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious harvest of the earth, being patient for it until he receives the early and late rains.  
You too, be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.  
Do not grumble against one another, brothers, or you will be judged; behold, the judge is standing at the door.  
Consider, my brothers, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as examples of suffering and patience.  
Indeed, we consider those who endure to be blessed. You have heard of Job's patience and have seen the outcome of the Lord; that the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.  
But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so that you may not fall into judgment.  
Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise.  
Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.  
And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up; if they have sinned, they will be forgiven.  
Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.  
Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.  
Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.  
Brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back,  
remember this: whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
