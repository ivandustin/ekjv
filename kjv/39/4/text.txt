For behold, the day is coming that will burn like an oven; all the proud and all who do wickedly will be like stubble. The coming day will consume them, says the LORD of hosts, leaving them neither root nor branch.

But for you who revere my name, the Sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; you will go out and grow strong like calves from the stall.

You will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act, says the LORD of hosts.

Remember the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, along with the statutes and judgments.

Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the LORD arrives.

He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a curse.
