The Philistines assembled all their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites camped by a spring in Jezreel.  
The lords of the Philistines marched on in groups of hundreds and thousands, but David and his men followed behind with Achish.  
The princes of the Philistines questioned, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish replied to the princes, "Isn't this David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel? He has been with me for some time now, and I have found no fault in him since he joined me."  
The princes of the Philistines were angry with Achish and said, "Send this man back so he can return to the place you assigned him. Let him not go into battle with us, or he may become an adversary. How could he reconcile with his master? Would it not be by taking the heads of these men?"  
"Isn't this the David they sang about in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"  
Achish then called David and said, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and your conduct with me in the army is commendable. I have found no wrongdoing in you since the day you came to me, but the lords do not favor you."  
"Therefore, return and go in peace, so you do not displease the lords of the Philistines."  
David replied to Achish, "What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the time I have been with you until now that would prevent me from fighting against the enemies of my lord the king?"  
Achish answered, "I know you are good in my sight, like an angel of God, but the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go into battle with us.'"  
"Therefore, rise early in the morning with your master's servants who have come with you. As soon as it is light, depart."  
So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, while the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
