There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, who was a powerful man.  
He had a son named Saul, a choice young man who was handsome; there was no one among the children of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders upward, he was taller than any of the people.  
Kish, Saul's father, had lost some donkeys. Kish said to Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys."  
They went through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them; then they passed through the land of Shalim, but they were not there; they also went through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.  
When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, "Come, let us return; otherwise my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us."  
The servant replied, "Look, in this city there is a man of God, and he is highly respected; everything he says comes true. Let’s go there; perhaps he will tell us which way to take."  
Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The bread in our bags is gone, and we have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"  
The servant answered Saul, "I have a quarter of a shekel of silver; I will give it to the man of God so he will tell us which way to go."  
(Previously in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today was once called a seer.)  
Saul said to his servant, "Good idea; let’s go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.  
As they were going up the hill to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked them, "Is the seer here?"  
They answered, "Yes, he is ahead of you. Hurry! He has just come to the city today, for the people are offering a sacrifice at the high place today."  
"As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he arrives, because he must bless the sacrifice. Afterward, those who are invited will eat. So get up now; you should find him about this time."  
They went up into the city, and as they entered, there was Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place.  
Now the LORD had revealed to Samuel the day before Saul arrived, saying,  
"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines, for I have heard their cry."  
When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about! He will govern my people."  
Saul approached Samuel at the gate and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?"  
Samuel replied, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you will eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and tell you all that is in your heart."  
As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and your father’s family?"  
Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel? And is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"  
Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited, about thirty in number.  
Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."  
So the cook took up the thigh and what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.  
When they came down from the high place to the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.  
They got up early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, and I will send you on your way." So Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside.  
As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us." (So he went on.) "But you stay here for a while, so I may give you a message from God."
