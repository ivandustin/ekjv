And David said to himself, "I will surely perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to quickly escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me in any part of Israel, and I will be safe from him."
So David arose and crossed over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
David and his men settled with Achish at Gath, each man with his household, including David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's widow.
When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.
David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please give me a place in one of the towns in the country so that I may dwell there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
Achish granted him Ziklag that day, which is why Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
David lived in the land of the Philistines for a year and four months.
David and his men went up and attacked the Geshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites, for those nations had long been the inhabitants of the land, extending as far as Shur and the land of Egypt.
David struck down the land, leaving no man or woman alive, and took the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and clothing, then returned to Achish.
Achish asked, "Where did you raid today?" David replied, "Against the southern region of Judah, the southern region of the Jerahmeelites, and the southern region of the Kenites."
David spared no man or woman alive to bring news to Gath, saying, "Lest they inform on us, saying, 'This is what David did,' and this will be his practice as long as he lives in the land of the Philistines."
Achish believed David, saying, "He has made his people Israel utterly despise him; therefore, he will be my servant forever."
