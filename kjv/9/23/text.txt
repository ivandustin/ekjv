Then they informed David, saying, "Look, the Philistines are attacking Keilah and stealing from the threshing floors."  
Therefore, David sought guidance from the LORD, asking, "Should I go and strike these Philistines?" The LORD replied to David, "Go, strike the Philistines, and rescue Keilah."  
David's men said to him, "Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the Philistine armies?"  
Then David sought the LORD again. The LORD answered him, saying, "Get up, go down to Keilah; for I will hand the Philistines over to you."  
So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines, took their livestock, and inflicted a great defeat on them. Thus, David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.  
It happened that when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to David at Keilah, he brought an ephod with him.  
When Saul was informed that David had come to Keilah, he said, "God has delivered him into my hands, for he has entered a town with gates and bars."  
Saul gathered all the people for battle to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.  
David realized that Saul was plotting against him, so he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring me the ephod."  
Then David prayed, "O LORD God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul is coming to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.  
Will the men of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I ask you to tell your servant." The LORD replied, "He will come down."  
David then asked, "Will the men of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?" The LORD answered, "They will surrender you."  
So David and his approximately six hundred men arose and left Keilah, going wherever they could. It was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, so he refrained from pursuing him.  
David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and remained in the mountains of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver David into his hands.  
David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life, and he was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest.  
Jonathan, Saul's son, went to David in the forest and strengthened his hand in God.  
He said to him, "Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will not find you; you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you. My father Saul knows this."  
The two made a covenant before the LORD; David stayed in the forest, and Jonathan returned to his home.  
Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Isn't David hiding among us in the strongholds of the forest, on the hill of Hachilah, south of Jeshimon?  
Now, therefore, O king, come down according to all your heart's desire, and we will hand him over to you."  
Saul replied, "Blessed are you of the LORD, for you have shown compassion to me.  
Go, I pray, prepare yet, and find out where he is hiding and who has seen him there; for I have been told that he is very crafty.  
So, be aware of all the hiding places where he conceals himself, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search for him among all the thousands of Judah."  
They arose and went to Ziph before Saul, but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain south of Jeshimon.  
Saul and his men went to seek him, and they informed David. Therefore, he went down to a rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.  
Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men were on the other side. David hurried to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to capture them.  
But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land."  
So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to fight against the Philistines; therefore, they called that place Selahammahlekoth.  
David then went up from there and dwelt in the strongholds at Engedi.
