The Philistines assembled their armies for battle and gathered at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, pitching their camp between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.  
Saul and the men of Israel also gathered, setting up camp by the valley of Elah, preparing for battle against the Philistines.  
The Philistines stood on one mountain, while Israel stood on another, with a valley in between them.  
A champion emerged from the Philistine camp, named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.  
He wore a bronze helmet on his head and was armed with a coat of mail, which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.  
He had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze shield slung between his shoulders.  
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and its head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; a shield-bearer walked before him.  
He stood and shouted to the armies of Israel, asking, "Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me."  
"If he is able to fight me and kill me, we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, you shall be our servants and serve us."  
The Philistine declared, "I defy the armies of Israel today; give me a man so we can fight together."  
When Saul and all Israel heard the words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.  
David was the son of an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons; he was known as an old man in the days of Saul.  
Jesse's three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: Eliab, the firstborn; Abinadab, next; and Shammah, the third.  
David was the youngest, and the three eldest followed Saul.  
David returned from Saul to tend to his father's sheep in Bethlehem.  
The Philistine approached morning and evening, presenting himself for forty days.  
Jesse instructed his son David, "Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;  
Carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news of them."  
Now Saul and the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.  
David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and went as Jesse had commanded him; he arrived at the trench as the army was going forth to battle and shouted for the fight.  
For Israel and the Philistines had arranged their battle lines, army against army.  
David left his supplies in the care of the keeper and ran into the army, greeting his brothers.  
As he spoke with them, the champion, Goliath of Gath, came up from the Philistine ranks and spoke the same words; David heard them.  
All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were terrified.  
The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come to defy Israel. The king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches, give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."  
David asked the men standing by him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes the disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"  
The people answered him in the same way, saying, "So shall it be done to the man who kills him."  
Eliab, his eldest brother, heard David speaking to the men, and Eliab's anger was kindled against David. He said, "Why have you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the wickedness of your heart; you have come down to see the battle."  
David replied, "What have I done now? Is there not a cause?"  
He turned away from Eliab and spoke to another, and the people answered him again in the same manner.  
When David's words were reported to Saul, he sent for him.  
David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."  
Saul replied to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight him, for you are just a youth, and he has been a warrior from his youth."  
David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,  
I went after it, struck it, and rescued the lamb from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it, and killed it.  
Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God."  
David continued, "The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and may the LORD be with you."  
Saul dressed David in his own armor, placing a bronze helmet on his head and a coat of mail on him.  
David fastened his sword over the armor and tried to walk, but he was not used to them. He said to Saul, "I cannot go in these, for I am not accustomed to them." So David took them off.  
He took his staff in hand, chose five smooth stones from the brook, put them in a shepherd's bag, and had his sling in hand as he approached the Philistine.  
The Philistine came closer to David, and the shield-bearer walked ahead of him.  
When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was just a youth, ruddy and handsome.  
The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And he cursed David by his gods.  
The Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field."  
David replied to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a shield, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.  
This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand; I will strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  
All those gathered here will know that the LORD does not save by sword or spear; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."  
As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.  
David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on the forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.  
So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, striking down the Philistine and killing him; but David had no sword in his hand.  
Therefore, David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it from its sheath, and killed him, cutting off his head. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.  
The men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines all the way to the valley and the gates of Ekron. The wounded Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron.  
The Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their tents.  
David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put the Philistine's armor in his own tent.  
When Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" Abner replied, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."  
The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."  
As David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head.  
Saul asked him, "Whose son are you, young man?" David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
