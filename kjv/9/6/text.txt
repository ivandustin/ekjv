The ark of the LORD remained in the territory of the Philistines for seven months.  
The Philistines summoned their priests and diviners, asking, "What should we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we can send it back to its place."  
They replied, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty; instead, return it with a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand is heavy upon you."  
They then asked, "What should be the trespass offering we return to Him?" They answered, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice, corresponding to the number of the lords of the Philistines, because one plague afflicted you and your lords."  
"Therefore, you should make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ruining the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, your gods, and your land."  
"Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When He dealt wondrously with them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"  
"Now, make a new cart and take two milk cows that have never been yoked. Tie the cows to the cart and take their calves home."  
"Place the ark of the LORD on the cart, and put the gold jewels you are returning as a trespass offering in a box beside it. Then send it away so it may go."  
"Watch and see if it goes up the road to its own territory to Bethshemesh. If it does, then He has done this great evil to us; but if not, we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; it was merely a coincidence."  
The men did as instructed; they took two milk cows, tied them to the cart, and confined their calves at home.  
They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart along with the box containing the gold mice and the images of their tumors.  
The cows took the straight path toward Bethshemesh, lowing as they went, not turning to the right or left, while the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Bethshemesh.  
The people of Bethshemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. They looked up, saw the ark, and rejoiced at the sight.  
The cart came to the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stopped there, near a large stone. They split the cart's wood and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.  
The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box with the gold jewels, placing them on the large stone. The men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrifices to the LORD that same day.  
When the five lords of the Philistines saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day.  
These are the golden tumors the Philistines returned as a trespass offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Askelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.  
The golden mice corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, including fortified cities and country villages, up to the great stone of Abel, where they set down the ark of the LORD. This stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.  
He struck down the men of Bethshemesh because they looked into the ark of the LORD, killing fifty thousand and seventy men. The people mourned because the LORD had inflicted a great slaughter among them.  
The men of Bethshemesh asked, "Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? To whom shall He go from us?"  
They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up to you."
