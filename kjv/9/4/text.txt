And the word of Samuel reached all of Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines and camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped in Aphek.  
The Philistines arranged themselves against Israel, and when the battle commenced, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, with about four thousand men slain in the field.  
When the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why has the LORD allowed us to be defeated today by the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh to us, so that it may save us from the hands of our enemies."  
So the people sent to Shiloh to retrieve the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.  
When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all of Israel shouted with a great shout, causing the earth to resound.  
Upon hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines asked, "What does this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" They realized that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.  
The Philistines were filled with fear, saying, "God has come into the camp. Woe to us! We have never seen anything like this before."  
"Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hands of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness."  
"Be strong and act like men, O Philistines, lest you become servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men and fight!"  
The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated; every man fled to his tent, resulting in a very great slaughter, with thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel falling.  
The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.  
A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the army and arrived in Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and dust on his head.  
When he arrived, Eli was sitting by the roadside, watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man entered the city and reported the news, the entire city cried out.  
When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he asked, "What does this tumult mean?" The man hurried in and informed Eli.  
Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim, so he could not see.  
The man said to Eli, "I am the one who escaped from the army and fled today." Eli asked, "What has happened, my son?"  
The messenger replied, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."  
As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his seat by the gate, broke his neck, and died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.  
His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was pregnant and near delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she bowed down and went into labor, for her pains came upon her.  
Just as she was about to die, the women standing by her said, "Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay attention.  
She named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.  
She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken."
