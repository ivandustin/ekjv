Then Nahash the Ammonite approached and camped against Jabesh-gilead, and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."  
Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I will make a covenant with you on this condition: that I may gouge out all your right eyes and bring disgrace upon all Israel."  
The elders of Jabesh responded, "Give us seven days' respite so that we may send messengers to all the regions of Israel; if no one comes to save us, we will surrender to you."  
The messengers arrived in Gibeah of Saul and reported the news to the people, who lifted their voices and wept.  
Just then, Saul returned from the field with the herd, and he asked, "What troubles the people that they weep?" They informed him of the situation concerning the men of Jabesh.  
When Saul heard the news, the Spirit of God came upon him, and his anger was greatly stirred.  
He took a yoke of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them throughout all the territories of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, "Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel, this will be done to his oxen." The fear of the LORD fell upon the people, and they rallied together as one.  
When he counted them at Bezek, the children of Israel numbered three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah totaled thirty thousand.  
They instructed the messengers who had come, "Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will receive help." The messengers delivered this message to the men of Jabesh, and they were filled with joy.  
Therefore, the men of Jabesh declared, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."  
The next day, Saul organized the people into three companies; they entered the enemy camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, and not two of them remained together.  
The people said to Samuel, "Who is it that questioned Saul's reign over us? Bring those men so we can put them to death."  
But Saul said, "No man shall be put to death today, for today the LORD has brought salvation to Israel."  
Samuel then said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there."  
All the people went to Gilgal, where they made Saul king before the LORD; they offered peace offerings to the LORD, and Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
