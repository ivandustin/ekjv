Now the Philistines engaged in battle against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from the Philistines, falling slain on Mount Gilboa.  
The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons relentlessly, killing Jonathan, Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.  
The battle pressed heavily against Saul, and the archers struck him; he was gravely wounded by their arrows.  
Saul then said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it; lest these uncircumcised men come and run me through and mistreat me." But his armor-bearer was too afraid to do so. Therefore, Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.  
When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died alongside him.  
Thus, Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day.  
When the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled; the Philistines then came and settled in them.  
The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  
They cut off his head, stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim it in the temples of their idols and among the people.  
They placed his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth and fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.  
When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,  
all the valiant men arose, traveled all night, took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and brought them to Jabesh, where they burned them.  
They took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.
