There was a certain man from Ramathaimzophim, in the hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
He had two wives; one was named Hannah, and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless.
Every year, this man went up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.
When the time came for Elkanah to offer sacrifices, he gave portions to Peninnah, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters.
But to Hannah, he gave a double portion because he loved her, even though the LORD had closed her womb.
Her rival provoked her severely to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
Year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her, and Hannah wept and would not eat.
Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
Hannah rose after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh. Eli the priest was sitting on a seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
In her deep anguish, Hannah prayed to the LORD, weeping bitterly.
She made a vow, saying, "O LORD of hosts, if you will look on the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."
As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. Therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.
Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine from you."
Hannah replied, "No, my lord; I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
Do not take your servant for a worthless woman; I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."
Eli answered, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him."
She said, "Let your servant find favor in your eyes." Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and then returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
In due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked for him from the LORD."
Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
But Hannah did not go up; she said to her husband, "I will not go up until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and dwell there forever."
Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. The child was young.
They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
She said, "Oh, my lord, as you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.
For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.
Therefore, I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
