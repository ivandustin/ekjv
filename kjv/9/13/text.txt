Saul reigned for one year; and after he had reigned for two years over Israel,  
Saul selected three thousand men from Israel; of these, two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on Mount Bethel, while a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, each to his own tent.  
Jonathan attacked the Philistine garrison in Geba, and the Philistines became aware of it. Saul then blew the trumpet throughout the land, proclaiming, "Let the Hebrews hear."  
All of Israel heard that Saul had struck down a Philistine garrison, and that the Philistines were now hostile toward Israel. The people rallied together behind Saul at Gilgal.  
The Philistines assembled to fight against Israel, with thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They advanced and camped in Michmash, east of Bethaven.  
When the men of Israel saw that they were in a difficult situation (for the people were distressed), they hid themselves in caves, thickets, rocks, high places, and pits.  
Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Meanwhile, Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people followed him, trembling.  
He waited seven days, as Samuel had instructed, but Samuel did not arrive at Gilgal, and the people began to scatter from him.  
Saul then said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." He offered the burnt offering.  
As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived; and Saul went out to greet him.  
Samuel asked, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,  
I said, 'The Philistines will now come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."  
Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the command of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. If you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.  
But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after His own heart and has appointed him as leader over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."  
Samuel then rose and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the men who were with him, about six hundred.  
Saul, Jonathan his son, and the men with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Michmash.  
The raiders came out of the Philistine camp in three groups: one group went toward Ophrah, in the land of Shual;  
another group went toward Bethhoron; and the third group went toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness.  
At that time, there was no blacksmith found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "Otherwise, the Hebrews will make swords or spears."  
So all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles sharpened.  
They had to use a file for the mattocks, coulters, forks, axes, and to sharpen the goads.  
Thus, on the day of battle, there was neither sword nor spear found in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, except for Saul and his son Jonathan, who had them.  
The Philistine garrison went out to the pass at Michmash.
