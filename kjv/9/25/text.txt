And Samuel passed away; all the Israelites gathered together, mourned for him, and buried him in his home at Ramah. David then arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
In Maon, there was a man whose possessions were in Carmel; he was very wealthy, owning three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
The man's name was Nabal, and his wife was Abigail. She was intelligent and beautiful, but Nabal was harsh and wicked in his actions; he belonged to the house of Caleb.
David learned in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
David sent ten young men, instructing them to go to Carmel, greet Nabal in his name, and deliver a message.
They were to say to him who lives in prosperity, "Peace be to you, peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have."
David continued, "I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not harm them, nor was anything missing from them while they were in Carmel."
"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Please let my young men find favor in your sight, for we come on a good day. I ask you to give whatever you can to your servants and to your son David."
When David's young men arrived, they spoke to Nabal all these words in the name of David and then waited.
Nabal responded to David's servants, saying, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who break away from their masters."
"Should I take my bread, my water, and the meat I have prepared for my shearers and give it to men whose origins I do not know?"
So David's young men turned back, returned, and reported all these words to him.
David said to his men, "Each of you, strap on your sword." They did so, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed behind to guard the supplies.
One of the young men informed Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he insulted them."
"The men treated us very well, and we were not harmed, nor did we miss anything while we were with them in the fields."
"They were like a protective wall around us both day and night while we were tending the sheep."
"Now, therefore, consider what you should do, for evil is determined against our master and his entire household. He is such a wicked man that no one can speak to him."
Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five dressed sheep, five measures of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, placing them on donkeys.
She instructed her servants, "Go on ahead of me; I will follow you." But she did not inform her husband Nabal.
As she rode on the donkey, she came down a hidden path on the hill, and behold, David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.
David had said, "It was in vain that I protected all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missing from him, and he has repaid me evil for good."
"May God do so to David's enemies, and more also, if I leave any of Nabal's men alive by morning."
When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from the donkey, fell on her face before him, and bowed to the ground.
She fell at his feet and said, "On me, my lord, be the blame. Let your servant speak in your presence and hear the words of your servant."
"Please do not pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for he is just like his name; Nabal means 'fool,' and folly is with him. I, your servant, did not see the young men you sent."
"Now, my lord, as the LORD lives and as you live, since the LORD has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, let your enemies and those who seek harm against you be like Nabal."
"Now, let this gift that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow you."
"I ask you to forgive the offense of your servant, for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord because you fight the battles of the LORD, and no wrongdoing has been found in you all your days."
"Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound securely in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God, and the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling."
"When the LORD has done for my lord all the good he has promised concerning you and has appointed you ruler over Israel,"
"this will not be a source of grief or a troubled conscience for you, my lord, either for shedding blood without cause or for avenging yourself. When the LORD has dealt well with my lord, remember your servant."
David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me."
"Blessed is your advice, and blessed are you, for you have kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand."
"Indeed, as the LORD, the God of Israel lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left by morning."
David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."
When Abigail returned to Nabal, he was holding a feast in his house like that of a king. Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing until morning.
In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal and his wife told him these things, his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.
About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt and has kept his servant from doing wrong. The LORD has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
When David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."
She arose, bowed down with her face to the ground, and said, "Here is your servant, ready to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
Abigail hurried, mounted her donkey, and followed the messengers of David, and she became his wife.
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.
However, Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Phalti, the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
