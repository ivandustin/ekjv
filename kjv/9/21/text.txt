David arrived at Nob to see Ahimelech the priest, who was frightened by David's presence and asked him, "Why are you alone, and why is no one with you?"
David replied to Ahimelech, "The king has tasked me with a mission and instructed me to keep it confidential. I have directed my servants to a specific location."
"Now, what do you have on hand? Please give me five loaves of bread or whatever you have available."
The priest responded to David, "I have no ordinary bread, only consecrated bread, provided the young men have kept themselves from women."
David assured the priest, "Indeed, we have been abstinent for three days since my departure, and the young men's vessels are holy. The bread is somewhat common, even though it was sanctified today."
So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, as there was no other bread available except the showbread, which had been removed from before the LORD to make room for hot bread on the day it was taken away.
On that day, a certain servant of Saul was present, detained before the LORD; his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
David asked Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or sword here? I did not bring my sword or weapons because I was in a hurry for the king's business."
The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it, for there is no other sword here." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
David then fled that day out of fear of Saul and went to Achish, the king of Gath.
The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Didn't they sing about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
David took these words to heart and was very afraid of Achish, the king of Gath.
He changed his behavior in front of them, pretending to be insane, scratching at the doors of the gate, and letting his saliva run down his beard.
Achish then said to his servants, "Look, you see the man is mad. Why have you brought him to me?
Do I need madmen that you have brought this fellow to act like a madman in my presence? Should this man come into my house?"
