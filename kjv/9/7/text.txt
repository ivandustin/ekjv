The men of Kirjathjearim came and retrieved the ark of the LORD, bringing it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD.  
While the ark remained in Kirjathjearim, a long time passed—twenty years—and all the house of Israel mourned for the LORD.  
Samuel addressed all the house of Israel, saying, "If you return to the LORD with all your hearts, then remove the foreign gods and Ashtaroth from among you, prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him alone; He will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines."  
The children of Israel removed Baalim and Ashtaroth and served the LORD alone.  
Samuel instructed, "Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD."  
They assembled at Mizpeh, drew water, poured it out before the LORD, fasted that day, and confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpeh.  
When the Philistines learned that the children of Israel had gathered at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines advanced against Israel. The children of Israel were afraid of the Philistines upon hearing this.  
The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines."  
Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; he cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD heard him.  
As Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines approached to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty thunder on that day against the Philistines, causing confusion among them, and they were defeated before Israel.  
The men of Israel emerged from Mizpeh and pursued the Philistines, striking them down until they reached Bethcar.  
Then Samuel took a stone, set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, declaring, "Thus far the LORD has helped us."  
The Philistines were subdued and did not invade the territory of Israel again; the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines throughout Samuel's days.  
The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hands of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.  
Samuel judged Israel throughout his lifetime.  
He traveled annually in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpeh, judging Israel in all those locations.  
His return was to Ramah, where his house was; there he judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD.
