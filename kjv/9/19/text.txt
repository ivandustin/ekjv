And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son, and to all his servants, instructing them to kill David.
But Jonathan, Saul's son, greatly admired David; he informed David, saying, "Saul, my father, seeks to kill you. Therefore, I urge you to take care of yourself until morning, and hide in a secret place."
"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with him about you; whatever I learn, I will tell you."
Jonathan spoke favorably of David to Saul, his father, saying, "Do not let the king sin against his servant, against David, for he has not sinned against you, and his actions have been very good toward you."
"For he risked his life and killed the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced; why then would you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
Saul listened to Jonathan's voice and swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be killed."
Jonathan called David and informed him of all these things. He then brought David to Saul, and David was in his presence as before.
There was war again, and David went out, fought the Philistines, and struck them with a great slaughter; they fled from him.
An evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul while he sat in his house with a javelin in his hand, and David played music.
Saul attempted to pin David to the wall with the javelin, but David evaded Saul's presence, causing the javelin to strike the wall instead. David fled and escaped that night.
Saul also sent messengers to David's house to watch him and kill him in the morning. Michal, David's wife, warned him, saying, "If you do not save your life tonight, you will be killed tomorrow."
So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.
Michal took an idol, placed it in the bed, put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with a cloth.
When Saul sent messengers to capture David, she said, "He is sick."
Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed so I can kill him."
When the messengers entered, they found the idol in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me like this and sent my enemy away so that he has escaped?" Michal replied, "He told me, 'Let me go; why should I kill you?'"
David fled, escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah, telling him all that Saul had done to him. They both went and dwelt in Naioth.
It was reported to Saul, saying, "David is at Naioth in Ramah."
Saul sent messengers to capture David, but when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.
When it was reported to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Saul sent messengers a third time, and they prophesied as well.
Then Saul went to Ramah and came to a great well in Sechu. He asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" One answered, "They are at Naioth in Ramah."
He went to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came upon him as well; he continued on and prophesied until he reached Naioth in Ramah.
He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in the same manner, lying down naked all that day and night. Therefore, they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
