The Philistines captured the ark of God and transported it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.  
After seizing the ark of God, the Philistines placed it in the temple of Dagon, positioning it beside their idol.  
When the people of Ashdod rose early the next morning, they discovered that Dagon had fallen face down on the ground before the ark of the LORD. They picked up Dagon and restored him to his place.  
However, when they awoke the following morning, they found Dagon had again fallen face down before the ark of the LORD; this time, his head and both hands were severed and lay on the threshold, leaving only the stump of Dagon intact.  
As a result, neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone entering Dagon's temple in Ashdod steps on the threshold to this day.  
The hand of the LORD was heavy upon the people of Ashdod, leading to their destruction and afflicting them with tumors, affecting both Ashdod and its surrounding areas.  
Upon realizing the severity of their situation, the men of Ashdod declared that the ark of the God of Israel could not remain with them, for His hand was pressing heavily upon them and upon their god Dagon.  
Consequently, they summoned all the lords of the Philistines and asked, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They replied, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be moved to Gath." So they transported the ark of the God of Israel there.  
After moving the ark, the hand of the LORD turned against the city, causing immense destruction; He struck down the inhabitants, both small and great, and they suffered from tumors in their private parts.  
Therefore, they sent the ark of God to Ekron. When the ark arrived in Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, "They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people!"  
In response, they gathered all the lords of the Philistines and urged, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its own place, so it does not kill us and our people, for there was a deadly plague throughout the entire city; the hand of God was very heavy upon us."  
Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city ascended to heaven.
