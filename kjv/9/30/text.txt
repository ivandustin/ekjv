And it came to pass, when David and his men arrived at Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, including Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, burning it with fire.
They had taken the women captive who were there; they did not kill anyone, whether great or small, but carried them away and went on their way.
So David and his men approached the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive.
Then David and the people with him raised their voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep.
David's two wives were taken captive: Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, as the souls of all the people were grieved, each man for his sons and daughters; but David found strength in the LORD his God.
David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, "Please bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" The LORD answered him, "Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."
So David went, he and the six hundred men with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
But David pursued, he and four hundred men; two hundred stayed behind because they were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread, and he ate; they made him drink water.
They also gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins; when he had eaten, his strength returned, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where are you from?" He replied, "I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; my master abandoned me because I fell sick three days ago."
"We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory belonging to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb; we burned Ziklag."
David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will lead you down to them."
When he had led David down, they were scattered over the countryside, eating and drinking and dancing because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
David attacked them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.
David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
Nothing was missing: small or great, sons or daughters, nor anything else they had taken; David brought everything back.
He took all the flocks and herds, which were driven ahead of the other livestock, and said, "This is David's plunder."
David returned to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who had been left behind at the brook Besor. They went out to meet David and the people with him, and when David approached them, he greeted them.
Then all the wicked men and troublemakers among those who had gone with David said, "Since they did not go out with us, we will not share with them any of the plunder we recovered; each man may take his wife and children and go."
David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us.
Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."
This became a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.
When David arrived at Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the enemies of the LORD."
He sent it to those in Bethel, in south Ramoth, and in Jattir,
to those in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and in Eshtemoa,
to those in Rachal, in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and in the cities of the Kenites,
to those in Hormah, in Chorashan, and in Athach,
to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David and his men had roamed.
