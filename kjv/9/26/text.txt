And the Ziphites approached Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Isn't David hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon?"  
Then Saul rose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, taking with him three thousand chosen men of Israel to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.  
Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, along the way. Meanwhile, David remained in the wilderness and saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness.  
David sent out spies and confirmed that Saul had indeed come.  
David then went to the place where Saul had camped; he observed where Saul lay, along with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul was lying in the trench, and the people were camped around him.  
David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai replied, "I will go down with you."  
So David and Abishai approached the camp at night, and behold, Saul was sleeping in the trench, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, while Abner and the people were camped around him.  
Then Abishai said to David, "God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now, let me strike him with the spear to the ground at once; I won't need to strike him a second time."  
But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?"  
David continued, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go into battle and perish."  
"Far be it from me to stretch out my hand against the LORD's anointed. Now, please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go."  
So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul's head, and they escaped without anyone noticing, for they were all asleep; a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.  
David then crossed to the other side and stood on the top of a hill far away, with a great distance between them.  
David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Do you not answer, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you that calls to the king?"  
David said to Abner, "Aren't you a valiant man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord the king."  
"This is not good what you have done. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die because you have not kept watch over your master, the LORD's anointed. Now see where the king's spear is and the jug of water that was at his head."  
Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" David replied, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."  
Saul asked, "Why does my lord pursue his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?"  
"Now, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is the children of men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'"  
"Now, let not my blood fall to the ground before the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains."  
Saul said, "I have sinned; return, my son David, for I will no longer harm you, because your life was precious in my sight today. Behold, I have acted foolishly and made a great mistake."  
David replied, "Here is the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and fetch it."  
"The LORD reward every man for his righteousness and faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD's anointed."  
"And behold, as your life was highly valued in my sight today, so let my life be valued in the sight of the LORD, and let Him deliver me from all tribulation."  
Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David! You shall both do great things and also prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
