And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When either a man or a woman separates themselves to make a vow of a Nazarite, dedicating themselves to the LORD:  
They shall separate themselves from wine and strong drink, and shall not drink vinegar made from wine or vinegar made from strong drink; they shall not drink any liquor made from grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried ones.  
Throughout the days of their separation, they shall eat nothing made from the vine, from the seeds to the skins.  
During the entire period of their vow, no razor shall come upon their head; until the days are fulfilled during which they separate themselves to the LORD, they shall be holy and let the locks of their hair grow.  
Throughout the days they separate themselves to the LORD, they shall not come near a dead body.  
They shall not make themselves unclean for their father, mother, brother, or sister when they die, because the consecration of their God is upon their head.  
Throughout the days of their separation, they are holy to the LORD.  
If a man dies suddenly beside them and they have defiled the head of their consecration, they shall shave their head on the day of their cleansing; on the seventh day, they shall shave it.  
On the eighth day, they shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, making atonement for them for having sinned by coming near the dead, and shall consecrate their head that same day.  
They shall dedicate to the LORD the days of their separation and bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering; however, the days that were before shall be lost because their separation was defiled.  
This is the law of the Nazarite: when the days of their separation are fulfilled, they shall be brought to the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation.  
They shall offer their offering to the LORD: one male lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, one female lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,  
along with a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, along with their grain offering and drink offerings.  
The priest shall present them before the LORD and offer their sin offering and burnt offering.  
They shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also offer their grain offering and drink offering.  
The Nazarite shall shave the head of their separation at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation, take the hair from the head of their separation, and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.  
The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall place them in the hands of the Nazarite after the hair of their separation has been shaved.  
The priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD; this is holy for the priest, along with the wave breast and heave shoulder; after that, the Nazarite may drink wine.  
This is the law of the Nazarite who has made a vow and of their offering to the LORD for their separation, in addition to what their hand can provide; according to the vow they made, so they must do according to the law of their separation.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is how you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them:  
The LORD bless you and keep you;  
The LORD make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you;  
The LORD lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.'  
And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them."
