The children of Israel, the entire congregation, entered the desert of Zin in the first month. The people settled in Kadesh, where Miriam passed away and was buried.
There was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron.
The people argued with Moses, saying, "Would that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"
"Why have you brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness for us and our cattle to die?"
"Why did you lead us out of Egypt to bring us to this terrible place? It is not a place of seed, figs, vines, or pomegranates; there is no water to drink."
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tabernacle and fell on their faces; the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Take the rod, gather the assembly together, you and your brother Aaron, and speak to the rock before their eyes; it will yield its water, and you will bring forth water from the rock for the congregation and their animals to drink."
Moses took the rod from before the LORD as he was commanded.
Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels; must we bring you water from this rock?"
Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; water gushed out abundantly, and the congregation drank, along with their animals.
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, "Because you did not believe in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, you shall not bring this congregation into the land I have given them."
This is the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with the LORD, and He was sanctified among them.
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying, "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardships that have befallen us.
Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we have lived there a long time; the Egyptians oppressed us and our ancestors.
When we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Now we are in Kadesh, a city at the edge of your territory.
Please let us pass through your country; we will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from your wells. We will travel along the king's highway and will not turn to the right or left until we have passed through your borders."
Edom replied, "You shall not pass through me, or I will come out against you with the sword."
The children of Israel said, "We will travel along the highway, and if I and my cattle drink your water, I will pay for it. I will only pass through on foot."
Edom responded, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against them with a large army and a strong hand.
Thus, Edom refused to allow Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.
The children of Israel, the entire congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor.
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, saying,
"Aaron will be gathered to his people, for he will not enter the land I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor.
Strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there."
Moses did as the LORD commanded; they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of the entire congregation.
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron died there on top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
When the entire congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for him for thirty days, all the house of Israel.
