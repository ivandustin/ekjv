And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Speak to the children of Israel, and let each of them take a rod according to the house of their fathers, with twelve rods from all their princes according to their families: write each man's name on his rod.  
And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi, for one rod shall represent the head of each family.  
You shall place them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.  
It shall come to pass that the rod of the man I choose will blossom, and I will put an end to the complaints of the children of Israel, who murmur against you.  
Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their princes gave him a rod, one for each prince, totaling twelve rods: and Aaron's rod was among them.  
Moses placed the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.  
The next day, Moses entered the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, produced buds, bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.  
Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to the children of Israel, and they looked and took each man his rod.  
The LORD said to Moses, "Bring Aaron's rod back before the testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels; and you shall completely remove their complaints from me, so they do not die."  
Moses did as the LORD commanded him.  
The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we are dying, we are perishing, we are all perishing.  
Whoever approaches anything near the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: are we to be consumed with dying?"
