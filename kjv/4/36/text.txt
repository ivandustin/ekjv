And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of the sons of Joseph, approached and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the chief fathers of the children of Israel.  
They said, "The LORD commanded my lord to allocate the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was instructed by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad, our brother, to his daughters."  
"If they marry any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus, it will be removed from the lot of our inheritance."  
"When the jubilee of the children of Israel occurs, their inheritance will revert to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus, their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."  
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, "The tribe of the sons of Joseph has spoken rightly."  
"This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: Let them marry whomever they choose, but only within the family of their father's tribe."  
"This way, the inheritance of the children of Israel will not shift from tribe to tribe, for each of the children of Israel shall retain the inheritance of their fathers' tribe."  
"Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall marry one of the family of her father's tribe, so that the children of Israel may each enjoy the inheritance of their fathers."  
"Nor shall the inheritance shift from one tribe to another tribe; each tribe of the children of Israel shall retain its own inheritance."  
Just as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:  
For Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married their father's brothers' sons.  
They married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father's family.  
These are the commandments and judgments that the LORD commanded through Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan near Jericho.
