The children of Israel journeyed onward and camped in the plains of Moab, on the side of the Jordan near Jericho.
Balak, the son of Zippor, observed all that Israel had accomplished against the Amorites.
Moab was greatly afraid of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
Moab said to the elders of Midian, "This company will consume everything around us, like an ox devours the grass of the field." At that time, Balak, the son of Zippor, was king of the Moabites.
He sent messengers to summon Balaam, the son of Beor, from Pethor, which is by the river in the land of his people, saying, "Look, a people has come out from Egypt; they cover the face of the earth and are camped opposite me.
Come now, I pray you, curse this people for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."
The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hands, and they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.
Balaam replied, "Lodge here tonight, and I will bring you word as the LORD speaks to me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
Balaam answered, "Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent for me, saying,
'Look, a people has come out of Egypt, covering the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out.'"
God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed."
Balaam rose early in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, "Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
The princes of Moab returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."
Balak sent more princes, more numerous and more honorable than the first.
They came to Balaam and said, "Thus says Balak, the son of Zippor: 'Do not let anything hinder you from coming to me,
for I will promote you to great honor and do whatever you say. Come, therefore, I pray you, curse this people for me.'"
Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
Now, I pray you, stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me."
God came to Balaam at night and said, "If the men come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall do."
Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
God's anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the way as an adversary against him. He was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
The donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with a drawn sword in his hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the path.
But the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself against the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against the wall, and he struck her again.
The angel of the LORD went further and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam, and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with a staff.
The LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?"
Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me; I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you."
The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do this to you?" And he said, "No."
Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with a drawn sword in his hand. He bowed his head and fell flat on his face.
The angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to withstand you because your way is perverse before me.
The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times; if she had not turned aside, surely I would have killed you and let her live."
Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the way against me. Now, if it displeases you, I will go back."
The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at a city of Moab on the border of Arnon, at the edge of the territory.
Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not earnestly send for you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to promote you to honor?"
Balaam said to Balak, "Look, I have come to you; I have no power to say anything. The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth.
Balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
The next day, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that he might see the farthest part of the people.
