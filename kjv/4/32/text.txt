The descendants of Reuben and Gad had a vast number of cattle. When they observed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, they recognized that it was suitable for livestock.  
The children of Gad and Reuben approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, saying,  
"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon,  
even the land that the LORD defeated before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle, and we have cattle."  
Therefore, they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, please grant this land to your servants as a possession, and do not lead us across the Jordan."  
Moses replied to the children of Gad and Reuben, "Will your brothers go to war while you stay here?"  
"Why do you discourage the hearts of the children of Israel from entering the land that the LORD has given them?"  
Your fathers did the same when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to explore the land.  
When they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the hearts of the children of Israel, preventing them from entering the land that the LORD had given them.  
The LORD's anger was aroused at that time, and He swore, saying,  
"Surely none of the men who came out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, will see the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they did not fully follow Me."  
Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they fully followed the LORD.  
The LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until the entire generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.  
And behold, you have risen in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to further provoke the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel.  
For if you turn away from following Him, He will leave them in the wilderness again, and you will destroy all this people.  
They approached him and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones."  
"But we ourselves will be ready and armed before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."  
"We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his inheritance."  
"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan or forward, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan, eastward."  
Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,  
and if all of you will go armed over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,  
and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you may return and be guiltless before the LORD and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD."  
"But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD; be sure your sin will find you out."  
"Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised."  
The children of Gad and Reuben replied to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands."  
"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle will remain in the cities of Gilead."  
"But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord has said."  
So concerning them, Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel,  
and Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession."  
"But if they do not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."  
The children of Gad and Reuben answered, saying, "As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do."  
"We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, so that the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan may be ours."  
Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad, the children of Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, along with the land and its cities in the region, including the cities of the surrounding area.  
The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer,  
Atroth, Shophan, Jaazer, and Jogbehah,  
Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.  
The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,  
Nebo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed), and Shibmah; and they gave other names to the cities they built.  
The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who was there.  
Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled there.  
Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns in the region and called them Havothjair.  
Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name.
