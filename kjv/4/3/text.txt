These are the generations of Aaron and Moses on the day the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.  
And these are the names of Aaron's sons: Nadab, the firstborn; Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
These are the names of the anointed priests, the sons of Aaron, whom he consecrated to serve in the priest's office.  
Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before Him in the wilderness of Sinai; they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the presence of their father Aaron.  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them before Aaron the priest so they may serve him.  
They shall keep his charge and the charge of the entire congregation before the tabernacle, performing the service of the tabernacle.  
They shall be responsible for all the furnishings of the tabernacle and the duties of the children of Israel in serving the tabernacle.  
You shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are entirely dedicated to him from among the children of Israel.  
You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall perform their priestly duties; any unauthorized person who approaches shall be put to death.  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Look, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that open the womb among the children of Israel; therefore, the Levites shall be mine.  
For all the firstborn are mine; on the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast; they are mine: I am the LORD."  
The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,  
"Count the children of Levi by their families, according to their fathers' houses; every male from a month old and upward shall be counted."  
Moses numbered them as the LORD commanded.  
These are the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  
These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.  
The sons of Kohath by their families are Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.  
The sons of Merari by their families are Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' houses.  
From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimites; these are the families of the Gershonites.  
The total number of males counted from a month old and upward was seven thousand five hundred.  
The families of the Gershonites shall camp behind the tabernacle to the west.  
The chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph, the son of Lael.  
The duties of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall include the tabernacle, the tent, its covering, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,  
as well as the hangings of the court and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle and the altar around it, along with the cords for all its service.  
Of Kohath were the families of the Amramites, Izeharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites; these are the families of the Kohathites.  
The total number of males counted from a month old and upward was eight thousand six hundred, responsible for the care of the sanctuary.  
The families of the sons of Kohath shall camp on the south side of the tabernacle.  
The chief of the house of the father of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel.  
Their duties shall include the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary used in their service, along with the hanging and all its service.  
Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, shall be chief over the leaders of the Levites and oversee those who keep charge of the sanctuary.  
Of Merari were the families of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these are the families of Merari.  
The total number of males counted from a month old and upward was six thousand two hundred.  
The chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel, the son of Abihail; they shall camp on the north side of the tabernacle.  
Under the care of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, and all its equipment,  
as well as the pillars of the court surrounding it, their sockets, pins, and cords.  
Those who camp in front of the tabernacle toward the east, in front of the tabernacle of the congregation, shall be Moses, Aaron, and his sons, keeping charge of the sanctuary for the children of Israel; any unauthorized person who approaches shall be put to death.  
All the Levites numbered by Moses and Aaron at the command of the LORD, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, totaled twenty-two thousand.  
The LORD said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and record their names.  
You shall take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel."  
Moses numbered all the firstborn among the children of Israel as the LORD commanded him.  
The total number of firstborn males counted by name from a month old and upward was twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.  
For those to be redeemed among the two hundred and seventy-three firstborn of the children of Israel who exceed the number of the Levites,  
you shall take five shekels each, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs).  
You shall give the redemption money for the excess number to Aaron and his sons."  
Moses took the redemption money for those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites:  
from the firstborn of the children of Israel, he took the money, totaling one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.  
Moses gave the redemption money for those redeemed to Aaron and his sons, as the LORD commanded Moses.
