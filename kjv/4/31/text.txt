And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel; afterward, you shall be gathered to your people."
Moses then addressed the people, saying, "Prepare yourselves for war; go against the Midianites and carry out the vengeance of the LORD."
"From each tribe, send a thousand men to the battle."
So, from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were chosen, totaling twelve thousand armed for battle.
Moses sent them to war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, equipped with the holy instruments and the trumpets in his hand.
They fought against the Midianites as the LORD commanded Moses, and they killed all the males.
They also killed the kings of Midian, including Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam, the son of Beor, with the sword.
The children of Israel took captive all the women of Midian and their little ones, and they seized the spoils of their cattle, flocks, and goods.
They burned all the cities where the Midianites lived, along with their beautiful castles, with fire.
They took all the spoils and all the prey, both of men and beasts.
They brought the captives, the prey, and the spoils to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho.
Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains over thousands and hundreds, who had returned from the battle.
Moses asked them, "Have you spared all the women alive?"
"Behold, these women caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to sin against the LORD in the matter of Peor, resulting in a plague among the congregation of the LORD."
"Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones and every woman who has known a man by lying with him."
"But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him."
"And you shall remain outside the camp for seven days; whoever has killed any person or touched any slain must purify themselves and their captives on the third and seventh days."
"Purify all your garments, everything made of leather, all work made of goat's hair, and all wooden items."
Eleazar the priest instructed the men of war who went to battle, "This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses:
Only the gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, and lead,
Everything that can withstand fire must be passed through the fire to be made clean; however, it must also be purified with the water of separation. Anything that cannot withstand fire must be passed through water."
"You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be clean; afterward, you may enter the camp."
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
"Take a census of the prey taken, both of man and beast, you and Eleazar the priest, along with the chief fathers of the congregation:
Divide the prey into two parts: one for those who went to battle and one for the entire congregation.
And levy a tribute to the LORD from the men of war who went to battle: one out of every five hundred, both of persons and of cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering to the LORD.
From the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty from the persons, cattle, donkeys, and flocks, of all kinds of beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
The booty, which was the rest of the prey captured by the men of war, amounted to six hundred thousand, seventy thousand, and five thousand sheep,
And sixty-two thousand cattle,
And sixty-one thousand donkeys,
And thirty-two thousand persons in total, of women who had not known a man by lying with him.
The half, which was the portion of those who went to war, totaled three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:
And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred fifteen.
The cattle numbered thirty-six thousand; the LORD's tribute was sixty-two.
The donkeys totaled thirty thousand five hundred; the LORD's tribute was sixty-one.
The persons numbered sixteen thousand; the LORD's tribute was thirty-two persons.
Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses separated from the men who fought,
(The half that belonged to the congregation was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
And thirty-six thousand cattle,
And thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
And sixteen thousand persons;)
From the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
The officers over thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds approached Moses:
They said to Moses, "Your servants have counted the men of war under our command, and not one man is missing.
We have brought an offering for the LORD, what each man has obtained: gold jewelry, chains, bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make atonement for our souls before the LORD."
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all the crafted jewelry.
The total gold offering they presented to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
(For the men of war had taken spoil, each man for himself.)
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation as a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
