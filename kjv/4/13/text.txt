And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Send men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, each one a leader among them."  
Moses, by the command of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran; all those men were leaders of the children of Israel.  
These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.  
From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.  
From the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.  
From the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.  
From the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.  
From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.  
From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.  
From the tribe of Joseph, specifically from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.  
From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.  
From the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.  
From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.  
From the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.  
These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Oshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua.  
Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan and said to them, "Go up this way southward and into the mountain.  
See what the land is like, and the people who dwell there, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;  
And what the land is like in which they live, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they inhabit, whether in tents or fortified cities;  
And what the land is, whether it is fertile or barren, whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage, and bring back some of the fruit of the land." Now the season was the time of the first ripe grapes.  
So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.  
They ascended through the south and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  
They came to the valley of Eshcol and cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men; they also brought back some pomegranates and figs.  
The place was called the valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes that the children of Israel cut down there.  
They returned from exploring the land after forty days.  
They went to Moses, Aaron, and the entire congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh, and brought back word to them and showed them the fruit of the land.  
They reported to him, saying, "We went to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; here is its fruit."  
However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there.  
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.  
Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it."  
But the men who went up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we."  
They brought back an evil report of the land they had explored to the children of Israel, saying, "The land through which we have gone to explore is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw in it are of great stature.  
There we saw the giants, the descendants of Anak, who come from the giants; and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight."
