And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he had married; indeed, he had married an Ethiopian woman.  
They said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard it.  
(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men on the face of the earth.)  
And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, saying, "Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of the congregation." So they three came out.  
The LORD descended in the pillar of the cloud, stood at the entrance of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.  
He said, "Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will make Myself known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream.  
My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all My house.  
With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in dark sayings; and he shall see the likeness of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?"  
The anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and He departed.  
The cloud departed from the tabernacle, and behold, Miriam became leprous, as white as snow; and Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.  
Aaron said to Moses, "Alas, my lord, I beseech you, do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned.  
Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."  
Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "Heal her now, O God, I beseech You."  
The LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be ashamed for seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp for seven days, and afterward let her be received again."  
Miriam was shut out from the camp for seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again.  
Afterward, the people moved from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
