And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying, "You and your sons, along with your father's household, shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; you and your sons shall also bear the iniquity of your priesthood."

"Bring your brethren from the tribe of Levi, your father's tribe, to join you and minister alongside you; but you and your sons shall serve before the tabernacle of witness."

"They shall keep your charge and the charge of the entire tabernacle; however, they must not approach the vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, lest they or you die."

"They shall be joined to you and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, performing all the service of the tabernacle; no outsider shall approach you."

"You shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, so that no wrath comes upon the children of Israel any longer."

"Behold, I have taken your brethren, the Levites, from among the children of Israel; they are a gift to you from the LORD to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."

"Therefore, you and your sons shall maintain your priestly office concerning everything at the altar and within the veil; you shall serve. I have given your priestly office to you as a gift, and any outsider who approaches shall be put to death."

"And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying, 'I have also given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; they are given to you by reason of your anointing, and to your sons, by an everlasting ordinance.'"

"This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation, every grain offering, every sin offering, and every trespass offering that they present to me shall be most holy for you and your sons."

"In the most holy place, you shall eat it; every male shall eat it; it shall be holy to you."

"And this is yours: the heave offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you, by a perpetual statute; everyone who is clean in your house may eat of it."

"All the best of the oil, all the best of the wine, and all the best of the wheat, the firstfruits of what they offer to the LORD, I have given to you."

"And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house may eat of it."

"Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours."

"Everything that opens the womb in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether of men or beasts, shall be yours; however, you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and the firstling of unclean animals you shall redeem."

"And those to be redeemed from a month old you shall redeem according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."

"But the firstling of a cow, sheep, or goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the LORD."

"The flesh of these shall be yours, just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are yours."

"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you, your sons, and your daughters with you, by a perpetual statute; it is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and your descendants."

"And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying, 'You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any part among them; I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.'"

"Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they perform, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."

"From now on, the children of Israel must not approach the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin and die."

"But the Levites shall perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity; this shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."

"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit; therefore, I have said to them, 'Among the children of Israel, they shall have no inheritance.'"

"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"

"Speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take from the children of Israel the tithes that I have given you from them for your inheritance, you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the LORD, a tenth part of the tithe.'"

"And this heave offering shall be counted to you as though it were the grain from the threshing floor and the fullness of the winepress."

"Thus, you shall also offer a heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive from the children of Israel; and you shall give the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest."

"From all your gifts, you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, even the hallowed part from it."

"Therefore, you shall say to them, 'When you have heaved the best of it from it, it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor and as the increase of the winepress.'"

"And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation."

"And you shall bear no sin because of it when you have heaved from it the best of it; neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die."
