And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,  
Let the children of Israel also observe the Passover at its appointed time.  
On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall observe it at its appointed time: according to all its rites and ceremonies, you shall observe it.  
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, instructing them to observe the Passover.  
And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.  
And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man, and they could not observe the Passover on that day; they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.  
And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept from offering the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the children of Israel?  
And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or your descendants is unclean due to a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still observe the Passover to the LORD.  
On the fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall observe it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  
They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break any of its bones: according to all the ordinances of the Passover, they shall observe it.  
But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and neglects to observe the Passover, that same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he did not bring the offering of the LORD at its appointed time, that man shall bear his sin.  
And if a stranger sojourns among you and wishes to observe the Passover to the LORD, according to the ordinance of the Passover and according to its manner, so shall he do: you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and for the native of the land.  
And on the day that the tabernacle was erected, the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at evening there was upon the tabernacle the appearance of fire, until morning.  
So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.  
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud rested, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.  
At the command of the LORD, the children of Israel journeyed, and at the command of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud rested upon the tabernacle, they rested in their tents.  
And when the cloud lingered upon the tabernacle many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not journey.  
And so it was, when the cloud was upon the tabernacle for a few days; according to the command of the LORD, they remained in their tents, and according to the command of the LORD, they journeyed.  
And so it was, when the cloud remained from evening until morning, and the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.  
Or whether it was for two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud lingered upon the tabernacle, remaining there, the children of Israel remained in their tents and did not journey: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.  
At the command of the LORD, they rested in their tents, and at the command of the LORD, they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
