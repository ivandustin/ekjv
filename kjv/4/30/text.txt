And Moses spoke to the leaders of the tribes regarding the children of Israel, saying, "This is the command that the LORD has given."  
If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a promise, he must not break his word; he must fulfill everything that comes out of his mouth.  
If a woman makes a vow to the LORD and binds herself by a promise while she is still living in her father's house during her youth;  
And if her father hears her vow and the promise by which she has bound her soul, and he remains silent about it, then all her vows shall remain valid, and every promise by which she has bound her soul shall remain valid.  
But if her father disallows her on the day he hears it, none of her vows or promises by which she has bound her soul shall remain valid; and the LORD will forgive her because her father disallowed her.  
And if she has a husband when she makes a vow or speaks anything with her lips that binds her soul;  
And if her husband hears it and remains silent on the day he hears it, then her vows shall remain valid, and the promises by which she has bound her soul shall remain valid.  
But if her husband disallows her on the day he hears it, then he nullifies the vow she made and the words she spoke with her lips that bound her soul; the LORD will forgive her.  
However, every vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which they have bound their souls, shall remain valid against her.  
And if she made a vow in her husband's house or bound her soul with a promise;  
And if her husband hears it and remains silent, not disallowing her, then all her vows shall remain valid, and every promise by which she has bound her soul shall remain valid.  
But if her husband completely nullifies them on the day he hears them, then whatever she spoke concerning her vows or the promise of her soul shall not remain valid; her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will forgive her.  
Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may confirm or nullify.  
But if her husband remains silent about her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows and all her promises that are upon her; he affirms them because he remained silent on the day he heard them.  
But if he nullifies them in any way after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.  
These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses regarding a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter who is still in her youth in her father's house.
