And it came to pass on the day that Moses had completely set up the tabernacle, anointed it, sanctified it, and all its instruments, including the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them;  
That the leaders of Israel, heads of their ancestral houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and were responsible for those who were counted, brought forth their offerings:  
And they presented their offerings before the LORD: six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they brought them before the tabernacle.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Receive these from them, that they may be used for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service."  
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.  
Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;  
And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.  
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because their service of the sanctuary was to carry it on their shoulders.  
And the leaders offered for the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed; indeed, the leaders presented their offerings before the altar.
