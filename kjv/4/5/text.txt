And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Command the children of Israel to expel from the camp every leper, everyone with an issue, and anyone who is defiled by the dead.  
Both male and female shall be put outside the camp; do not allow them to defile the camp in which I dwell.  
The children of Israel complied and expelled them from the camp, just as the LORD commanded Moses.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that if a man or woman commits any sin that people commit, thereby trespassing against the LORD, and that person is guilty;  
Then they must confess their sin and make restitution for their wrongdoing, adding a fifth of the value to it, and give it to the one they have wronged.  
But if the man has no relative to make restitution to, the restitution shall be made to the LORD, even to the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.  
And every offering of all the holy things brought by the children of Israel to the priest shall belong to him.  
And every man's consecrated things shall belong to him: whatever any man gives to the priest shall be his.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife goes astray and commits a trespass against him,  
And a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from her husband, and kept secret, and she is defiled, with no witness against her, nor is she caught in the act;  
And if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he becomes jealous of his wife, whether she is defiled or not;  
Then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a jealousy offering, a memorial offering, bringing iniquity to remembrance.  
And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD;  
And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and from the dust of the tabernacle floor, the priest shall take and put it into the water;  
And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, uncover her head, and place the memorial offering in her hands, which is the jealousy offering; and the priest shall hold the bitter water that causes the curse.  
And the priest shall administer an oath to her, saying, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, you shall be free from this bitter water that causes the curse.  
But if you have gone aside to another instead of your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you beside your husband:  
Then the priest shall administer the oath of cursing, and he shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD causes your thigh to rot and your belly to swell;  
And this water that causes the curse shall enter your bowels, making your belly swell and your thigh rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.  
And the priest shall write these curses in a book and shall blot them out with the bitter water;  
And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter her and become bitter.  
Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering from the woman's hand, wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar;  
And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, even the memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.  
And when he has made her drink the water, if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband, the water that causes the curse shall enter her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall become a curse among her people.  
But if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive.  
This is the law regarding jealousies, when a wife goes astray to another instead of her husband and is defiled;  
Or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he is jealous of his wife, and he shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall carry out all this law upon her.  
Then the man shall be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
