And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho, saying,  
Command the children of Israel to give the Levites cities from their inheritance to dwell in; and you shall also give the Levites suburbs for the cities surrounding them.  
The cities shall be for them to dwell in, and the suburbs shall be for their cattle, goods, and all their beasts.  
The suburbs of the cities that you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.  
You shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; the city shall be in the midst: these shall be the suburbs of the cities for them.  
Among the cities that you shall give to the Levites, there shall be six cities of refuge, which you shall designate for the manslayer, so he may flee there; and you shall add forty-two cities to them.  
Thus, all the cities you shall give to the Levites shall total forty-eight cities, along with their suburbs.  
The cities you shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel: from those who have many, you shall give many; but from those who have few, you shall give few: each shall give from his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance.  
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them, When you have crossed over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,  
Then you shall designate cities to be cities of refuge for you, so that the slayer may flee there, who kills any person unintentionally.  
These cities shall serve as refuge for you from the avenger, so that the manslayer does not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.  
Of these cities that you shall give, six cities shall be designated for refuge.  
You shall give three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities shall be given in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.  
These six cities shall be a refuge for both the children of Israel and for the stranger and sojourner among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.  
If he strikes him with an iron instrument, causing his death, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  
If he strikes him with a stone that could cause death, and he dies, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  
Or if he strikes him with a wooden weapon that could cause death, and he dies, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  
The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he shall kill him.  
But if he thrusts him out of hatred, or hurls something at him lying in wait, causing his death;  
Or in enmity strikes him with his hand, causing his death: he who struck him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.  
But if he thrusts him suddenly without enmity, or has thrown anything upon him without lying in wait,  
Or with any stone that could cause death, not seeing him, and casts it upon him, causing his death, and he was not his enemy, nor sought his harm:  
Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments:  
And the congregation shall deliver the slayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and restore him to the city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.  
But if the slayer comes at any time outside the borders of the city of refuge to which he fled;  
And the avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of the city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood:  
Because he should have remained in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest, the slayer shall return to the land of his possession.  
These things shall be a statute of judgment for you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.  
Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the testimony of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.  
Moreover, you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death: he shall surely be put to death.  
And you shall take no satisfaction for him who has fled to the city of refuge, that he should return to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.  
So you shall not pollute the land in which you dwell: for blood defiles the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, except by the blood of him who shed it.  
Do not defile therefore the land which you inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I, the LORD, dwell among the children of Israel.
