Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, who were all descendants of Reuben, gathered a group of men.  
They confronted Moses, accompanied by certain children of Israel, specifically two hundred and fifty prominent leaders of the assembly, well-known figures in the congregation.  
They united against Moses and Aaron, accusing them, saying, "You take too much upon yourselves, considering that the entire congregation is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you elevate yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?"  
Upon hearing this, Moses fell on his face.  
He addressed Korah and all his followers, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy; He will bring near to Himself the one He has chosen."  
"Do this: Take censers, Korah, and all your followers;  
Put fire in them and add incense before the LORD tomorrow. The man whom the LORD chooses will be the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, sons of Levi."  
Moses then said to Korah, "Listen, I pray, you sons of Levi:  
Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to Himself, to serve in the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?  
He has brought you near to Him, along with all your fellow Levites. Are you now seeking the priesthood as well?  
This is why you and your followers have gathered against the LORD. What is Aaron that you complain against him?"  
Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they replied, "We will not come up.  
Is it a trivial matter that you have brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, unless you make yourself a prince over us?  
Furthermore, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you blind these men? We will not come up."  
Moses was very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I harmed any of them."  
Moses instructed Korah, "You and all your followers are to present yourselves before the LORD tomorrow, you, they, and Aaron.  
Each man is to take his censer, put incense in it, and bring it before the LORDâ€”two hundred and fifty censers; you and Aaron each must also have your own censer."  
So each man took his censer, put fire in them, added incense, and stood at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.  
Korah gathered the entire congregation against them at the entrance of the tabernacle, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.  
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  
"Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant."  
They fell on their faces and said, "O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and be angry with the entire congregation?"  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Tell the congregation to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."  
Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.  
He said to the congregation, "Depart, I pray, from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be consumed in all their sins."  
So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents, along with their wives, sons, and little children.  
Moses declared, "By this you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; I have not done them of my own accord.  
If these men die a natural death or experience the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me.  
But if the LORD performs a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up, along with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have provoked the LORD."  
As soon as he finished speaking, the ground split open beneath them.  
The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, and all the men associated with Korah, along with all their possessions.  
They and all that belonged to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed over them; they perished from among the congregation.  
All Israel around them fled at their cries, saying, "Lest the earth swallow us up too!"  
Then a fire came out from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who had offered incense.  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers out of the fire and scatter the fire some distance away, for they are holy.  
The censers of these sinners against their own souls should be made into broad plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before the LORD; therefore, they are holy and will serve as a sign to the children of Israel."  
Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which the burned men had offered, and made them into broad plates for a covering of the altar,  
to serve as a memorial to the children of Israel, so that no outsider who is not of the seed of Aaron may come near to offer incense before the LORD, lest he be like Korah and his company, as the LORD instructed him through Moses.  
But the next day, the entire congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of the LORD."  
When the congregation gathered against Moses and Aaron, they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.  
Moses and Aaron went before the tabernacle of the congregation.  
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  
"Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant." They fell on their faces.  
Moses said to Aaron, "Take a censer, put fire from the altar in it, add incense, and go quickly to the congregation to make atonement for them, for the wrath of the LORD has gone out; the plague has begun."  
Aaron did as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation. The plague had already begun among the people, and he put on incense and made atonement for the people.  
He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was halted.  
The number of those who died in the plague was fourteen thousand seven hundred, in addition to those who died because of Korah.  
Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the plague was stopped.
