And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; He heard it, and His anger was kindled. The fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed those in the outermost parts of the camp.  
The people cried out to Moses, and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.  
He named the place Taberah because the fire of the LORD burned among them.  
The mixed multitude among them began to crave food, and the children of Israel wept again, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat?"  
"We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.  
But now our souls are dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes."  
The manna was like coriander seed, and its color was like the color of bdellium.  
The people went out, gathered it, ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar, baked it in pans, and made cakes of it; its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.  
When the dew fell upon the camp at night, the manna fell with it.  
Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; the anger of the LORD was greatly kindled, and Moses was also displeased.  
Moses said to the LORD, "Why have You afflicted Your servant? Why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You lay the burden of all this people upon me?  
Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, that You should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child,' to the land which You swore to their fathers?  
Where can I get meat to give to all this people? They weep before me, saying, 'Give us flesh that we may eat.'  
I cannot bear all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.  
If You deal with me like this, kill me, I pray, if I have found favor in Your sight; do not let me see my wretchedness."  
The LORD said to Moses, "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.  
I will come down and talk with you there; I will take of the spirit that is upon you and put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it alone.  
Say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat? It was better for us in Egypt." Therefore, the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.  
You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days;  
But for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"  
Moses said, "The people I am with are six hundred thousand footmen, and You have said, 'I will give them flesh that they may eat for a whole month.'  
Shall the flocks and herds be slain for them to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them?"  
The LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened? You shall see now whether My word will come to pass to you or not."  
Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD; he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them around the tabernacle.  
The LORD came down in a cloud and spoke to him; He took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it to the seventy elders. When the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and did not cease.  
However, two men remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. The spirit rested upon them; they were among those who were written but did not go out to the tabernacle, and they prophesied in the camp.  
A young man ran and told Moses, saying, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."  
Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, "My lord Moses, forbid them!"  
Moses said to him, "Are you envious for my sake? Would that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put His spirit upon them!"  
Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.  
A wind went forth from the LORD and brought quails from the sea, letting them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.  
The people stood up all that day, all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. He who gathered the least gathered ten homers, and they spread them out for themselves around the camp.  
While the flesh was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.  
He named that place Kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people who had craved.  
The people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth and camped at Hazeroth.
