And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  
This is the ordinance of the law that the LORD has commanded: Speak to the children of Israel and instruct them to bring you a red heifer without spot, in which there is no blemish, and upon which no yoke has ever come.  
You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, so that he may bring her outside the camp, and one shall slay her in his presence.  
Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger and sprinkle it directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.  
One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, her flesh, her blood, and her dung shall be burned.  
The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning heifer.  
Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening.  
The one who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening.  
A clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place; they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.  
The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; this shall be a statute for the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, forever.  
Whoever touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean for seven days.  
He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he shall not be clean.  
Whoever touches the dead body of any man and does not purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; that soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him; he remains unclean, and his uncleanness is still upon him.  
This is the law when a man dies in a tent: all who enter the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.  
Every open vessel that has no covering bound upon it is unclean.  
Whoever touches one who has been slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days.  
For an unclean person, they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt heifer for purification from sin, and running water shall be added to it in a vessel.  
A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, upon all the vessels, upon the persons who were there, and upon anyone who touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave.  
The clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; on the seventh day, he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, bathe himself in water, and shall be clean by evening.  
But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water of separation has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.  
It shall be a perpetual statute for them that the one who sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and whoever touches the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.  
Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.
