18,job,13,2,"What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you."
18,job,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
18,job,13,4,"But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value."
18,job,13,5,O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
18,job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
18,job,13,7,Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
18,job,13,8,Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
18,job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?"
18,job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons."

18,job,13,19,"Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost."
18,job,13,20,Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
18,job,13,21,Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
18,job,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me."
18,job,13,23,How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
18,job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?"
18,job,13,25,Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
18,job,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
