Then Bildad the Shuhite responded and said,  
How long will you continue to speak these things? And how long will the words from your mouth be like a fierce wind?  
Does God distort justice? Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?  
If your children have sinned against Him, and He has cast them away for their transgressions;  
If you would seek God earnestly and make your supplication to the Almighty;  
If you were pure and upright; surely now He would awaken for you and make the dwelling of your righteousness prosperous.  
Though your beginning was small, your latter end will greatly increase.  
For I urge you to inquire of the former generations and prepare yourself to search their ancestors:  
(For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, because our days on earth are like a shadow:)  
Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak words from their hearts?  
Can the rush grow without mire? Can the flag grow without water?  
While it is still green and not cut down, it withers before any other herb.  
So are the paths of all who forget God; and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:  
Whose hope will be cut off, and whose trust will be like a spider's web.  
He will lean on his house, but it will not stand; he will hold it fast, but it will not endure.  
He is green before the sun, and his branch shoots forth in his garden.  
His roots are wrapped around the heap and see the place of stones.  
If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, "I have not seen you."  
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and from the earth, others will grow.  
Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, nor will He help evildoers:  
Until He fills your mouth with laughter and your lips with rejoicing.  
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.
