Then Zophar the Naamathite responded and said,  
Shouldn't the abundance of words be addressed? And can a man who talks excessively be justified?  
Should your lies cause others to remain silent? And when you mock, will no one make you feel ashamed?  
For you have claimed, "My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your sight."  
But oh, that God would speak and open His lips against you;  
And that He would reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, which are twice as deep as what is! Know, therefore, that God requires of you less than what your iniquity deserves.  
Can you, by searching, find out God? Can you discover the Almighty to perfection?  
It is as high as heaven; what can you do? Deeper than hell; what can you know?  
The measure of it is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.  
If He cuts off, shuts up, or gathers together, who can stop Him?  
For He knows vain men; He sees wickedness as well; will He not then take it into account?  
For vain men would be wise, even though man is born like a wild donkey's colt.  
If you prepare your heart and stretch out your hands toward Him;  
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tents.  
For then you will lift up your face without spot; yes, you will be steadfast and will not fear:  
Because you will forget your misery and remember it as waters that have passed away:  
And your age will be clearer than the noonday; you will shine forth; you will be like the morning.  
And you will be secure, for there is hope; yes, you will dig around you, and you will rest in safety.  
Also, you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid; yes, many will seek your favor.  
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and they will not escape, and their hope will be like the giving up of the spirit.
