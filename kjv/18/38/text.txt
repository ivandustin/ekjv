Then the LORD spoke to Job from the whirlwind, saying,
"Who is this that obscures counsel with words lacking knowledge?
Prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.
Who determined its measurements, if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line across it?
On what were its foundations set? Or who laid its cornerstone,
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst forth, as if it had come from the womb?
When I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band,
And prescribed limits for it, setting bars and doors,
And said, 'You may come this far, but no farther; here is where your proud waves stop'?
Have you ever commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, shaking the wicked out of it?
It is changed like clay under the seal; and they stand out like a garment.
From the wicked their light is withheld, and the uplifted arm is broken.
Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all.
Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And as for darkness, where is its place,
That you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its house?
Do you know it because you were born then, or because the number of your days is great?
Have you entered the storehouses of the snow? Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war?
By what way is light dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?
Who has cut a channel for the flood of waters, or a path for the thunderstorm;
To bring rain on a land where no one lives, on the desert that is barren and empty;
To satisfy the desolate wasteland and make the tender grass spring forth?
Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?
From whose womb did the ice come? And the frost of heaven, who has given birth to it?
The waters are hidden like stone, and the surface of the deep is frozen.
Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades, or loose the cords of Orion?
Can you bring forth the constellations in their season, or guide the Bear with its cubs?
Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth?
Can you raise your voice to the clouds, that an abundance of water may cover you?
Can you send out lightning bolts, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'?
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the heart?
Who can count the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven,
When the dust becomes hard and the clods stick together?
Will you hunt prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
When they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in their lairs?
Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God, wandering about for lack of food?"
