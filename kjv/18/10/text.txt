My soul is weary of life; I will keep my complaints to myself; I will express the bitterness of my soul.  
I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why you contend with me.  
Is it good for you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands, and to favor the counsel of the wicked?  
Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as a man sees?  
Are your days like the days of man? Are your years like man's days,  
That you inquire about my iniquity and search for my sin?  
You know that I am not wicked; and there is no one who can deliver me from your hand.  
Your hands have made and fashioned me all around; yet you destroy me.  
Remember, I beseech you, that you have made me like clay; will you bring me back to dust?  
Have you not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese?  
You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and fenced me with bones and sinews.  
You have granted me life and favor, and your visitation has preserved my spirit.  
And these things you have hidden in your heart: I know that this is with you.  
If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me of my iniquity.  
If I am wicked, woe is me; and if I am righteous, I will not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore, see my affliction;  
For it increases. You hunt me like a fierce lion: and again you show yourself marvelous against me.  
You renew your witnesses against me and increase your indignation toward me; changes and war are against me.  
Why then have you brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  
I should have been as if I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.  
Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me be, that I may find a little comfort,  
Before I go where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;  
A land of darkness, as dark as itself; and of the shadow of death, without order, where the light is as darkness.
