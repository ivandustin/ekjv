So these three men stopped responding to Job, as he considered himself righteous.
Then the anger of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite from the clan of Ram, was aroused against Job because he justified himself instead of God.
Elihu's anger was also kindled against his three friends, for they had found no answer yet condemned Job.
Elihu had waited for Job to speak, as they were older than he.
When Elihu noticed that these three men had no response, his anger flared up.
Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, spoke up and said, "I am young, and you are very old; therefore, I was afraid and did not dare to express my opinion."
I thought, "Days should speak, and a multitude of years should impart wisdom."
But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.
Great men are not always wise, nor do the aged always understand justice.
Therefore, I said, "Listen to me; I too will share my opinion."
Behold, I waited for your words; I listened to your arguments while you sought to find what to say.
Indeed, I paid attention to you, and behold, none of you convinced Job or answered his words.
Lest you say, "We have discovered wisdom; God has cast him down, not man."
Now, he has not directed his words against me, nor will I respond to him with your arguments.
They were astonished and did not speak anymore; they ceased from their discourse.
After I had waited (for they did not speak, but stood still and remained silent),
I said, "I will also respond; I too will share my opinion."
For I am full of words; the spirit within me compels me.
Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; it is ready to burst like new wineskins.
I will speak so that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and respond.
Let me not, I pray, show partiality to any man, nor give flattering titles to anyone.
For I do not know how to give flattering titles; if I did, my Maker would soon take me away.
