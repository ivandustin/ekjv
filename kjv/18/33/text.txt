Wherefore, Job, I beseech you, listen to my words and pay attention to all I say.  
Behold, I have opened my mouth; my tongue has spoken within me.  
My words will reflect the integrity of my heart, and my lips will express knowledge clearly.  
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life.  
If you can answer me, arrange your words before me and stand up.  
Behold, I am here in God's place, formed from the same clay as you.  
My fear will not intimidate you, nor will my hand weigh heavily upon you.  
Surely, you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard your words, saying,  
"I am clean and without transgression; I am innocent; there is no iniquity in me."  
Behold, He finds reasons to accuse me; He considers me His enemy.  
He places my feet in stocks and observes all my paths.  
Behold, in this you are not justified: I will respond to you that God is greater than man.  
Why do you contend with Him? He does not owe an account of any of His matters.  
For God speaks once, yes, twice, yet man does not perceive it.  
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings on their beds;  
Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction,  
To turn man from his purpose and to hide pride from him.  
He keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword.  
He is also chastened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones suffers greatly:  
So that his life loathes bread, and his soul detests dainty food.  
His flesh wastes away, so that it cannot be seen; and his bones, once hidden, protrude.  
Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.  
If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show man his uprightness:  
Then he is gracious to him and says, "Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom."  
His flesh will be fresher than a child's; he will return to the days of his youth.  
He will pray to God, and God will be favorable to him; he will see His face with joy, for He will restore to man his righteousness.  
He looks upon men, and if any say, "I have sinned and perverted what is right, and it has not benefited me,"  
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life will see the light.  
Lo, all these things God often does with man,  
To bring back his soul from the pit, to enlighten him with the light of the living.  
Mark well, O Job, listen to me: hold your peace, and I will speak.  
If you have anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you.  
If not, listen to me: hold your peace, and I shall teach you wisdom.
