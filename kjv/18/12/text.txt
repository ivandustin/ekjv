And Job responded, saying,  
"Surely you are the people, and wisdom will perish with you.  
Yet I possess understanding just as you do; I am not less than you: indeed, who is unaware of such matters?  
I am like one who is mocked by his neighbor, who calls upon God, and He answers him: the righteous and upright man is ridiculed.  
The one who is about to stumble is regarded as a lamp despised by those who are at ease.  
The tents of robbers thrive, and those who provoke God are secure; into whose hands God grants abundance.  
But inquire now of the animals, and they will instruct you; and the birds of the air, and they will inform you:  
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you.  
Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?  
In His hand is the soul of every living being, and the breath of all mankind.  
Does not the ear test words? And does not the mouth taste food?  
With the aged is wisdom; and in length of days is understanding.  
With Him are wisdom and strength; He has counsel and understanding.  
Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He shuts a man in, and there is no escape.  
Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; He sends them out, and they overturn the earth.  
With Him are strength and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are both His.  
He leads counselors away spoiled and makes judges foolish.  
He loosens the bonds of kings and girds their loins with a belt.  
He leads princes away spoiled and overthrows the mighty.  
He removes the speech of the trustworthy and takes away the understanding of the aged.  
He pours contempt upon princes and weakens the strength of the mighty.  
He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings to light the shadow of death.  
He increases nations and destroys them; He enlarges nations and then restricts them again.  
He takes away the heart of the leaders of the earth and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path.  
They grope in the dark without light, and He makes them stagger like a drunken man."
