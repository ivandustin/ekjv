There was a man in the land of Uz named Job; he was a perfect and upright man who feared God and shunned evil.  
He had seven sons and three daughters.  
His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household; thus, he was the greatest man in the East.  
His sons would host feasts in their homes on their respective days, and they would send for their three sisters to join them in eating and drinking.  
When the days of feasting were completed, Job would send for them and consecrate them; he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular practice.  
One day, the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.  
The LORD asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan replied, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."  
The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."  
Satan replied to the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?  
Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.  
But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."  
The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your power; but on the man himself do not lay a finger." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.  
One day, while his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,  
a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,  
when the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."  
While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, "The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants; I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."  
While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."  
While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,  
when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them, and they are dead; I am the only one who has escaped to tell you."  
At this, Job got up, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell to the ground in worship.  
He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."  
In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
