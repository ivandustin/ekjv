Then Zophar the Naamathite responded and said,  
My thoughts compel me to speak, and I feel the urgency to respond.  
I have heard the rebuke of my shame, and the spirit of my understanding drives me to reply.  
Do you not know this from ancient times, since humanity was established on the earth?  
That the triumph of the wicked is brief, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only a moment?  
Though his pride soars to the heavens, and his head reaches the clouds,  
He will perish forever like his own waste; those who have seen him will ask, "Where is he?"  
He will vanish like a dream and will not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night.  
The eye that once beheld him will see him no more; his place will no longer be recognized.  
His children will strive to please the needy, and his hands will restore their possessions.  
His bones are filled with the sins of his youth, which will lie down with him in the dust.  
Though wickedness may taste sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue,  
Though he spares it and does not let it go, but keeps it within his mouth,  
Yet his food will turn in his stomach; it will become the poison of asps within him.  
He has swallowed wealth, but he will vomit it up again; God will cast it out of his belly.  
He will drink the venom of asps; the viper's tongue will kill him.  
He will not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.  
What he has labored for he will restore, and he will not enjoy it; according to his wealth, the restitution will be, and he will not rejoice in it.  
Because he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; because he has violently taken away a house he did not build,  
Surely he will not find peace in his belly; he will not save any of what he desired.  
None of his food will remain; therefore, no one will look for his possessions.  
In the fullness of his sufficiency, he will be in distress; every hand of the wicked will come against him.  
When he is about to fill his belly, God will unleash the fury of his wrath upon him and rain it down while he is eating.  
He will flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel will pierce him.  
It is drawn and comes out of his body; yes, the glittering sword emerges from his gall: terrors will surround him.  
All darkness will be hidden in his secret places; a fire not blown will consume him; it will go badly for him who is left in his tent.  
Heaven will expose his iniquity; and the earth will rise up against him.  
The increase of his household will depart, and his possessions will flow away in the day of his wrath.  
This is the fate of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance appointed to him by God.
