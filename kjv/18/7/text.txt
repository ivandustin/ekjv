Is there not a designated time for humanity on earth? Are not our days akin to those of a hired worker?  
Just as a servant longs for the shade, and a laborer anticipates the reward for his toil:  
So I find myself burdened with months of futility, and exhausting nights are assigned to me.  
When I lie down, I ponder, "When will I rise, and the night be over?" I am restless, tossing and turning until dawn breaks.  
My body is infested with worms and covered in dust; my skin is broken and repulsive.  
My days pass more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle, spent in despair.  
Oh, remember that my life is but a breath: my eyes will no longer see goodness.  
The gaze of those who have seen me will not behold me again; your eyes are upon me, yet I am no more.  
As the cloud dissipates and vanishes, so too shall the one who descends to the grave rise no more.  
He will not return to his home, nor will his place recognize him again.  
Therefore, I will not hold back my words; I will express the anguish of my spirit; I will voice the bitterness of my soul.  
Am I a sea or a great fish, that you set a watch over me?  
When I say, "My bed will bring me comfort, my couch will ease my troubles,"  
You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions:  
So much so that my soul prefers strangulation and death over my existence.  
I detest it; I do not wish to live forever: leave me alone, for my days are futile.  
What is humanity, that you should exalt him? Why do you set your heart upon him?  
And why do you visit him each morning, testing him every moment?  
How long will you not depart from me, nor allow me to be until I swallow my saliva?  
I have sinned; what can I do to you, O preserver of humanity? Why have you made me a target for your wrath, becoming a burden to myself?  
And why do you not forgive my transgressions and remove my iniquity? For now, I will lie down in the dust; you will seek me in the morning, but I will not be.
