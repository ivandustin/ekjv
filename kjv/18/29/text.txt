Moreover, Job continued his discourse and said,  
"Oh, that I were as I was in months gone by, in the days when God protected me;  
When His light shone upon my head, and by His illumination, I walked through the darkness;  
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God rested upon my dwelling;  
When the Almighty was still with me, and my children surrounded me;  
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured forth rivers of oil for me;  
When I went out to the city gate, and prepared my seat in the public square!  
The young men saw me and hid themselves; the aged arose and stood in my presence.  
The princes held their tongues and placed their hands over their mouths.  
The nobles remained silent, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.  
When the ear heard me, it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it bore witness to me:  
Because I delivered the poor who cried out, and the fatherless, and those who had no one to help them.  
The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, and I made the widow's heart rejoice.  
I donned righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was like a robe and a crown.  
I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.  
I was a father to the needy, and I investigated causes I did not know.  
I broke the jaws of the wicked and rescued the plunder from their teeth.  
Then I said, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days like the sand.'  
My roots were spread out by the waters, and the dew lay upon my branches all night.  
My glory was fresh within me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.  
Men listened to me, waited, and kept silent at my counsel.  
After my words, they did not speak again; my speech fell upon them like rain.  
They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the latter rain.  
If I laughed at them, they did not believe it; and they did not cast down the light of my countenance.  
I chose their path, sat as chief, and dwelt like a king in the army, comforting those who mourned."
