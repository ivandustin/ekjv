Elihu continued to speak, saying,  
"Allow me a moment, and I will demonstrate that I still have much to say on behalf of God.  
I will draw my knowledge from afar and attribute righteousness to my Creator.  
For my words are indeed true: the one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.  
Look, God is powerful and does not disregard anyone; He is strong in both might and wisdom.  
He does not spare the life of the wicked but grants justice to the poor.  
He does not turn His gaze away from the righteous; they are seated with kings on thrones; indeed, He establishes them forever, and they are exalted.  
And if they are bound in chains and held in cords of affliction,  
Then He reveals to them their deeds and the transgressions they have committed.  
He also opens their ears to discipline and commands them to turn away from iniquity.  
If they obey and serve Him, they will enjoy prosperity throughout their days and pleasures in their years.  
But if they do not obey, they will perish by the sword and die without understanding.  
The hypocrites in heart accumulate wrath; they do not cry out when He binds them.  
They die in their youth, and their lives are among the unclean.  
He rescues the poor in their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.  
He would have removed you from distress to a wide place, where there is no constraint; and what should be set before you would be abundant.  
But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked; judgment and justice have laid hold of you.  
Because there is wrath, be cautious lest He take you away with His stroke; then no great ransom can save you.  
Will He value your riches? No, not gold, nor all the might of your strength.  
Do not long for the night when people are cut off in their place.  
Take heed; do not regard iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction.  
Look, God is exalted by His power; who teaches like Him?  
Who has prescribed His way? Or who can say, 'You have done wrong'?  
Remember to magnify His work, which all men can see.  
Every person may observe it; humanity can behold it from afar.  
Look, God is great, and we do not know Him; the number of His years cannot be searched out.  
For He makes the drops of water small; they pour down rain according to the vapor.  
The clouds drop and distill upon man abundantly.  
Can anyone understand the spread of the clouds or the sound of His pavilion?  
Look, He spreads His light upon it and covers the depths of the sea.  
For by them He judges the people; He provides food in abundance.  
With clouds, He covers the light and commands it not to shine through the cloud that comes between.  
The sound thereof reveals concerning it, and the cattle also regarding the vapor."
