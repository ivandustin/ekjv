After Job opened his mouth, he cursed the day of his birth.
And Job spoke, saying,
"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that declared, 'A male child is conceived.'
Let that day be engulfed in darkness; may God not look upon it from above, nor let light shine upon it.
Let gloom and the shadow of death envelop it; let a cloud settle over it; let the darkness of the day terrify it.
As for that night, let darkness seize it; may it not be counted among the days of the year, nor included in the number of the months.
Behold, let that night be desolate; let no joyful voice be heard within it.
Let those who curse the day curse it, those who are prepared to raise their lament.
Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it long for light, but find none; let it not see the dawn of day.
Because it did not shut the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, nor conceal sorrow from my eyes.
Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I came from the womb?
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts that I might suck?
For now I would have lain still and been quiet; I would have slept and been at rest,
With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
Or like a hidden stillborn, I would not have existed; like infants who never saw the light.
There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary find rest.
There the prisoners rest together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
Both small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,
Who long for death, but it does not come; who dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
Who rejoice greatly and are glad when they find the grave?
Why is light given to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has enclosed?
For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like water.
For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened to me.
I was not in safety, nor had I rest, nor was I quiet; yet trouble came."
