Furthermore, Elihu responded and said,  
"Listen to my words, O wise men; give ear to me, you who possess knowledge.  
For the ear tests words, just as the mouth tastes food.  
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us discern together what is good.  
For Job has claimed, 'I am righteous,' and God has removed my right to judgment.  
Should I lie about my rights? My wound is incurable without wrongdoing.  
What man is like Job, who drinks in scorn as if it were water?  
He associates with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men.  
For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing to take delight in God.'  
Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God to do evil, and from the Almighty to commit injustice.  
For He will repay a man according to his deeds and cause every person to find according to their ways.  
Indeed, God will not act wickedly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.  
Who has appointed Him over the earth? Who has set the whole world in order?  
If He were to set His heart on man, if He were to gather to Himself His spirit and breath,  
All flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.  
If you have understanding, hear this: listen to the voice of my words.  
Can one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the One who is most just?  
Is it appropriate to say to a king, 'You are wicked,' and to princes, 'You are ungodly'?  
How much less to Him who does not show favoritism to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of His hands.  
In an instant, they will die, and the people will be troubled at midnight and pass away; the mighty will be taken away without a hand.  
For His eyes are on the ways of man, and He sees all his actions.  
There is no darkness or shadow of death where the workers of iniquity can hide.  
For He will not impose on man more than is right, so that he may enter into judgment with God.  
He will shatter mighty men without number and set others in their place.  
Therefore, He knows their works and overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.  
He strikes them as wicked men in the sight of others;  
Because they have turned back from Him and do not consider any of His ways.  
So they cause the cry of the poor to reach Him, and He hears the cry of the afflicted.  
When He gives peace, who can cause trouble? When He hides His face, who can behold Him? Whether it is against a nation or just an individual:  
So that the hypocrite does not reign, lest the people be ensnared.  
Surely, it is appropriate to say to God, 'I have endured chastisement; I will not offend again.'  
Teach me what I do not see; if I have done wrong, I will do so no more.  
Should it be according to your mind? He will repay it, whether you refuse or choose; it is not I who decides, so speak what you know.  
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me.  
Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words lack wisdom.  
My desire is for Job to be tested to the end because of his responses to wicked men.  
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
