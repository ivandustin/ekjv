A man born of a woman has a brief life filled with troubles.
He emerges like a flower, only to be cut down; he flees like a shadow and does not endure.
Do you truly open your eyes to such a one and bring me into judgment with you?
Who can create something pure from something impure? Not one.
Since his days are numbered, and the count of his months is with you, you have set boundaries he cannot cross;
Turn away from him, so he may find rest until he completes his time, like a hired worker.
For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its tender branches will not cease.
Though its roots may grow old in the earth, and its trunk may die in the ground;
Yet, with the scent of water, it will bud and produce branches like a plant.
But man dies and fades away; indeed, he breathes his last, and where is he?
As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:
So man lies down and does not rise; until the heavens are no more, they will not awaken nor be raised from their sleep.
Oh, that you would hide me in the grave, that you would keep me secret until your wrath has passed, that you would set a time for me and remember me!
If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my appointed time, I will wait until my change comes.
You will call, and I will answer you; you will long for the work of your hands.
For now, you count my steps; do you not watch over my sin?
My transgression is sealed in a bag, and you stitch up my iniquity.
And surely, the falling mountains come to nothing, and the rock is removed from its place.
The waters wear away the stones; you wash away the things that grow from the dust of the earth, and you destroy the hope of man.
You prevail forever against him, and he passes away; you change his appearance and send him away.
His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, but he perceives nothing of them.
But his flesh will feel pain, and his soul within him will mourn.
