But Job replied and said,  
"Listen carefully to my words, and let this be your source of comfort.  
Allow me to speak; and once I have spoken, feel free to mock me.  
Is my complaint directed at a human being? If so, why should my spirit not be troubled?  
Pay attention to me, and be amazed; place your hand over your mouth.  
Even when I remember, I am filled with fear, and trembling grips my body.  
Why do the wicked live on, grow old, and become powerful?  
Their descendants are secure in their presence, and their offspring are before their eyes.  
Their homes are free from fear, and the rod of God does not rest upon them.  
Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not lose their young.  
They send out their little ones like a flock, and their children dance with joy.  
They take up the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of music.  
They spend their days in prosperity, and suddenly they descend to the grave.  
Therefore, they say to God, 'Leave us alone; we do not want to know your ways.'  
What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? What do we gain if we pray to Him?  
Indeed, their prosperity is not in their hands; the plans of the wicked are far from me.  
How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished! How often does their calamity come upon them! God distributes sorrows in His anger.  
They are like stubble before the wind, like chaff that the storm sweeps away.  
God stores up their iniquity for their children; He rewards them, and they will know it.  
Their eyes will witness their destruction, and they will drink the wrath of the Almighty.  
What pleasure does he find in his house after him, when the number of his days is cut short?  
Can anyone teach God knowledge, since He judges those who are high?  
One person dies in full strength, completely at ease and secure.  
His body is well-nourished, and his bones are filled with marrow.  
Another dies in bitterness of soul, never enjoying anything good.  
They both lie down in the dust, and worms cover them.  
Behold, I know your thoughts and the schemes you devise against me.  
For you ask, 'Where is the house of the noble? Where are the dwelling places of the wicked?'  
Have you not asked those who travel the road? Do you not know their signs,  
That the wicked are reserved for the day of destruction? They will be brought forth for the day of wrath.  
Who can declare his way to his face? Who can repay him for what he has done?  
Yet he will be brought to the grave and remain in the tomb.  
The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and all men will follow after him, as countless have done before him.  
How then can you comfort me in vain, when your answers contain nothing but falsehood?"
