Then Job responded and said,  
Even today, my complaint is bitter; my suffering is heavier than my groaning.  
Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I could approach His seat!  
I would present my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.  
I would know the words He would use to answer me and understand what He would say to me.  
Will He contend with me in His great power? No; rather, He would give me strength.  
There, the righteous could argue with Him; thus, I would be delivered forever from my judge.  
Behold, I go forward, but He is not there; I go backward, but I cannot perceive Him.  
On the left side, where He works, I cannot see Him; He hides Himself on the right side, so I cannot find Him.  
But He knows the way I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.  
My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.  
I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.  
But He is of one mind, and who can change Him? What His soul desires, that He does.  
For He carries out what is appointed for me; many such things are in His plans.  
Therefore, I am troubled in His presence; when I consider, I am afraid of Him.  
For God makes my heart tender, and the Almighty terrifies me.  
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, nor has He concealed the darkness from my face.
