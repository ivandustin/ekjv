Then Bildad the Shuhite responded and said,  
"How long will you continue speaking? Consider, and then we will respond."  
"Why are we regarded as animals, and deemed worthless in your eyes?"  
"He tears at himself in his rage: will the earth be abandoned for you? Will the rock be moved from its place?"  
"Indeed, the light of the wicked will be extinguished, and the spark of their fire will not shine."  
"The light will be dark in his dwelling, and his lamp will be extinguished with him."  
"The strength of his steps will be confined, and his own counsel will bring him down."  
"For he is caught in a net by his own feet, and he walks into a trap."  
"The snare will seize him by the heel, and the thief will overcome him."  
"A trap is set for him on the ground, and a snare lies in his path."  
"Fears will surround him on every side, driving him to his feet."  
"His strength will be consumed by hunger, and destruction will be ready at his side."  
"It will devour the strength of his skin; even the firstborn of death will consume his strength."  
"His confidence will be uprooted from his dwelling, and it will lead him to the king of terrors."  
"It will reside in his dwelling, for it is not his; brimstone will be scattered upon his home."  
"His roots will dry up beneath him, and his branches will be cut off above."  
"His memory will perish from the earth, and he will have no name in the streets."  
"He will be driven from light into darkness, and expelled from the world."  
"He will have neither son nor nephew among his people, nor anyone left in his homes."  
"Those who come after him will be astonished at his fate, just as those before were terrified."  
"Surely, such is the fate of the wicked, and this is the dwelling of one who does not know God."
