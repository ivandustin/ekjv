Moreover, Job continued his discourse and said,  
"As God lives, who has taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who has troubled my soul;  
As long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;  
My lips will not speak wickedness, nor will my tongue utter deceit.  
God forbid that I should justify you; until I die, I will not remove my integrity from me.  
I hold fast to my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart will not reproach me as long as I live.  
Let my enemy be like the wicked, and he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.  
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, even if he gains, when God takes away his soul?  
Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?  
Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?  
I will teach you by the hand of God; I will not conceal what is with the Almighty.  
Behold, you have all seen it; why then are you altogether vain?  
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive from the Almighty.  
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.  
Those who remain of him shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.  
Though he heaps up silver like dust and prepares garments like clay;  
He may prepare it, but the just shall wear it, and the innocent shall divide the silver.  
He builds his house like a moth, and like a booth that the keeper makes.  
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered; he opens his eyes, and he is not.  
Terrors take hold of him like waters; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.  
The east wind carries him away, and he departs; as a storm hurls him out of his place.  
For God shall cast upon him and not spare; he would gladly flee out of His hand.  
Men shall clap their hands at him and hiss him out of his place."
