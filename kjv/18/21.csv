18,job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them."

18,job,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
18,job,21,25,"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure."

18,job,21,32,"Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."
18,job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him."
18,job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
