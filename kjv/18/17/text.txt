My breath is tainted, my days are numbered, the graves await me.  
Are there not mockers among me? Does my eye not remain fixed on their provocation?  
Lay down now, secure a pledge with me; who will join hands with me?  
For you have concealed their hearts from understanding; therefore, you shall not elevate them.  
He who flatters his friends will find even his children's eyes dimmed.  
He has made me a byword among the people; once, I was like a tambourine.  
My eye is dimmed from sorrow, and all my limbs feel like shadows.  
Upright men will be astonished at this, and the innocent will rally against the hypocrite.  
The righteous will continue on their path, and he who has clean hands will grow stronger.  
But as for all of you, return and come now: I cannot find a single wise man among you.  
My days have passed, my plans are shattered, even the thoughts of my heart.  
They turn night into day: the light is brief due to darkness.  
If I wait, the grave becomes my home: I have made my bed in darkness.  
I have called corruption my father, and to the worm, I have said, "You are my mother and sister."  
And where is my hope now? As for my hope, who will see it?  
They will descend to the depths of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
