As Jesus walked by, he noticed a man who had been blind since birth.  
His disciples inquired, "Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"  
Jesus replied, "Neither this man nor his parents have sinned; rather, this happened so that the works of God might be revealed in him."  
"I must carry out the work of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work."  
"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."  
After saying this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and applied it to the blind man's eyes.  
He instructed him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). The man went, washed, and returned able to see.  
The neighbors and those who had previously seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?"  
Some said, "This is him," while others argued, "No, he looks like him." The man himself said, "I am the one."  
They asked him, "How were your eyes opened?"  
He answered, "A man named Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and told me to go to Siloam and wash. I went, washed, and received my sight."  
They then asked him, "Where is he?" He replied, "I don't know."  
They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.  
It was the Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.  
The Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight. He said, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see."  
Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not observe the Sabbath." Others argued, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" Thus, there was division among them.  
They asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."  
However, the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and received his sight until they called in his parents.  
They asked them, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How is it that he now sees?"  
His parents answered, "We know this is our son, and that he was born blind.  
But we do not know how he now sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. He is of age; ask him; he can speak for himself."  
His parents said this because they feared the Jews, who had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.  
So they said, "He is of age; ask him."  
They called the man who had been blind again and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know this man is a sinner."  
He replied, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see."  
They asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"  
He answered, "I have already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"  
They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple; we are disciples of Moses.  
We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."  
The man answered, "This is remarkable! You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.  
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to the one who worships him and does his will.  
Since the beginning of time, no one has ever heard of anyone opening the eyes of a person born blind.  
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."  
They replied, "You were born entirely in sin, and are you trying to teach us?" And they threw him out.  
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he asked, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"  
He answered, "Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"  
Jesus said, "You have seen him; he is the one speaking with you."  
He said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.  
Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."  
Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked, "Are we blind too?"  
Jesus replied, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains."
