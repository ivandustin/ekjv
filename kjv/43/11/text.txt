A certain man named Lazarus was sick; he was from Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.  
(This is the same Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair; her brother Lazarus was sick.)  
So his sisters sent a message to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick."  
When Jesus heard this, he said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."  
Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.  
When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed two more days in the same place where he was.  
Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."  
His disciples replied, "Rabbi, the Jews just tried to stone you, and you are going back there?"  
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.  
But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."  
He said these things, and then added, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him."  
His disciples said, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover."  
However, Jesus was speaking about his death, but they thought he meant natural sleep.  
Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.  
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; nevertheless, let us go to him."  
Then Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."  
When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.  
Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs away.  
Many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.  
As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed at home.  
Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.  
But I know that even now, whatever you ask of God, God will give it to you."  
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."  
Martha replied, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."  
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he may die, yet shall he live.  
And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"  
She said to him, "Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."  
After she said this, she went back and secretly called her sister Mary, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."  
As soon as Mary heard this, she quickly got up and went to him.  
Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.  
The Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, and they followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."  
When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."  
When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.  
He asked, "Where have you laid him?" They said, "Lord, come and see."  
Jesus wept.  
Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"  
But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind have kept this man from dying?"  
Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.  
"Take away the stone," he said. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days."  
Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"  
So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.  
I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."  
When he had said this, he called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"  
The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."  
Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him.  
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.  
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many signs.  
If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation."  
Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!  
You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."  
He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,  
and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together.  
So from that day on they plotted to take his life.  
Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews; instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.  
The Jewish Passover was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.  
They kept looking for Jesus and as they stood in the temple courts, they asked one another, "What do you think? Isnâ€™t he coming to the festival at all?"  
But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.
