I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he removes; and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, so that it may produce more fruit.
Now you are clean through the word that I have spoken to you.
Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and people gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
This is how my Father is glorified: that you bear much fruit and prove to be my disciples.
As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
This is my commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you.
No one has greater love than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
From now on, I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
This is my command: Love one another.
If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
Remember what I told you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.
If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’
When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
