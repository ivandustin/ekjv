Here is the edited version of each line:
1. Six days before Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus, who had died, was raised from the dead.
2. They prepared a supper for him, and Martha served, while Lazarus sat at the table with him.
3. Mary took a pound of very costly spikenard ointment, anointed Jesus' feet, and wiped them with her hair, filling the house with the fragrance of the ointment.
4. One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray him, said,
5. "Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?"
6. He said this not out of concern for the poor, but because he was a thief, having the money bag and stealing from it.
7. Jesus replied, "Leave her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial."
8. "You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me."
9. Many Jews knew he was there and came not only for Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
10. The chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death as well,
11. because many Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus because of Lazarus.
12. The next day, a large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
13. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"
14. Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written,
15. "Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."
16. At first, his disciples did not understand these things, but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
17. The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead testified.
18. That is why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard he had performed this sign.
19. The Pharisees said to one another, "You see, you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!"
20. Among them were some Greeks who had come to worship at the festival.
21. They approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
22. Philip went to tell Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went to tell Jesus.
23. Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
24. "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."
25. "Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
26. "Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me."
27. "Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour."
28. "Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
29. The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
30. Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine."
31. "Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out."
32. "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
33. He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
34. The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
35. Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going."
36. "Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
37. Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
38. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
39. For this reason, they could not believe, because as Isaiah says elsewhere,
40. "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turnâ€”and I would heal them."
41. Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.
42. Yet at the same time, many even among the leaders believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue.
43. For they loved human praise more than praise from God.
44. Then Jesus cried out, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me."
45. "The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me."
46. "I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness."
47. "If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world."
48. "There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day."
49. "For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken."
50. "I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."
