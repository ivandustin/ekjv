Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, and whom he raised from the dead.
There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray him,
"Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?"
This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and took what was put therein.
Then Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
For the poor you always have with you, but me you do not always have."
Much of the Jewish crowd therefore knew that he was there, and they came not only for Jesus' sake but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death,
Because many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus because of him.
On the next day, a great crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
Took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him, and cried, "Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"
And Jesus, when he had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,
"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."
These things his disciples did not understand at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.
For this reason, the crowd also met him, for they heard that he had done this miracle.
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are gaining nothing? Behold, the world has gone after him."
And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast.
These came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
Philip went and told Andrew; and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
And Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.
Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit.
He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor.
Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose, I came to this hour.
Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again."
The crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered; others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come because of me, but for your sake.
Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
This he said, signifying by what death he would die.
The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
Then Jesus said to them, "A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.
While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light." These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.
But although he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,
That the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,
"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and turn, so that I should heal them."
These things Isaiah said when he saw his glory and spoke of him.
Nevertheless, among the rulers, many believed in him; but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue,
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.
And he who sees me sees him who sent me.
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.
And if anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
He who rejects me and does not receive my words has that which judges him: the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day.
For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.
And I know that his command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told me, so I speak."
