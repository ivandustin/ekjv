Here is a revised version of each line:

1. Jesus spoke these words, lifted his eyes to heaven, and said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, so that your Son may also glorify you.
2. Just as you have given him authority over all humanity, so he can grant eternal life to all those you have given him.
3. And this is eternal life: to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
4. I have glorified you on earth; I have completed the work you gave me to do.
5. And now, O Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.
6. I have revealed your name to the people you gave me out of the world; they were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
7. Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
8. For I have given them the words you gave me; they have received them, and they know with certainty that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
9. I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.
10. All that is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine; and I am glorified in them.
11. And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one.
12. While I was with them, I kept them safe by your name; those you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost except the one doomed to destruction, so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
13. Now I am coming to you, and I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
14. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
15. I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one.
16. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
17. Sanctify them by your truth; your word is truth.
18. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
19. And for their sake, I sanctify myself, that they too may be sanctified by the truth.
20. I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in me through their message;
21. That all of them may be one; Father, just as you are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
22. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one:
23. I in them and you in me, so that they may be brought to complete unity; then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
24. Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
25. Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.
26. I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known, in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.
