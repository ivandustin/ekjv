On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus' mother was present.  
Both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.  
When they ran out of wine, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."  
Jesus replied, "Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come."  
His mother instructed the servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."  
There were six stone water jars there, used for the Jewish purification rites, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.  
Jesus told them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.  
He then said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the headwaiter." They did so.  
When the headwaiter tasted the water that had been turned into wine, he did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew). The headwaiter called the bridegroom  
and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk; but you have kept the good wine until now."  
This was the first of the signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, revealing his glory; and his disciples believed in him.  
After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there for only a few days.  
The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  
In the temple, he found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting there.  
He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple, along with the sheep and the oxen; he poured out the money changers' coins and overturned their tables.  
To those selling doves, he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a marketplace!"  
His disciples remembered that it is written, "Zeal for your house will consume me."  
The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"  
Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."  
The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"  
But he was speaking about the temple of his body.  
After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.  
While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.  
But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.  
He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.
