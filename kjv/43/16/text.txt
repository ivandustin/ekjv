Here are the edited lines:

I have shared these things with you so that you will not be troubled.  
They will expel you from the synagogues; indeed, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will believe they are serving God.  
They will do these things to you because they do not know the Father or me.  
But I have told you these things so that when the time comes, you will remember that I warned you. I did not mention these things to you at the beginning because I was with you.  
Now, I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me, "Where are you going?"  
But because I have said these things to you, your hearts are filled with sorrow.  
However, I tell you the truth: it is for your benefit that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.  
And when he comes, he will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment:  
Of sin, because they do not believe in me;  
Of righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you will see me no longer;  
Of judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.  
I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.  
However, when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things to come.  
He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.  
All that the Father has is mine; therefore, I said that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.  
In a little while, you will not see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me, because I am going to the Father.  
Then some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while, you will not see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father'?"  
They asked, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We do not understand what he is saying."  
Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another about what I said, 'In a little while, you will not see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me'?"  
Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.  
A woman giving birth has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.  
So with you, now is your time of grief, but I will see you again, and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.  
In that day, you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.  
Until now, you have not asked for anything in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.  
I have spoken these things to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly about the Father.  
In that day, you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.  
For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.  
I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.  
His disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.  
Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not need anyone to ask you; this makes us believe that you came from God."  
Jesus replied, "Do you now believe?  
A time is coming, and in fact has come, when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.  
I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
