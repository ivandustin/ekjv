If someone is found slain in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess, lying in the field, and it is not known who has killed him:  
Then your elders and judges shall come forward, and they shall measure to the cities that are around the slain individual:  
And it shall be that the city closest to the slain man, the elders of that city shall take a heifer that has not been worked with and has not pulled a yoke;  
The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a rough valley that is neither plowed nor sown, and shall sever the heifer's neck there in the valley:  
And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near; for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word, every controversy and every stroke shall be resolved:  
And all the elders of that city, nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that has been beheaded in the valley:  
And they shall answer and say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it."  
Be merciful, O LORD, to your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of your people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.  
Thus, you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.  
When you go out to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands, and you take them captive,  
And you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her to be your wife;  
Then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails;  
And she shall remove the garments of her captivity and remain in your house, mourning for her father and mother for a full month; and after that, you may go in to her, and she shall be your wife.  
And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go wherever she wishes; but you shall not sell her for money, nor shall you make merchandise of her, because you have humbled her.  
If a man has two wives, one loved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the hated; and if the firstborn son is from the hated wife:  
Then it shall be, when he makes his sons inherit what he has, he may not treat the son of the loved wife as the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is indeed the firstborn:  
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.  
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and when they have chastened him, he will not listen to them:  
Then his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his place;  
And they shall say to the elders of his city, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard."  
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones so that he dies; thus, you shall put away evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.  
And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death and is to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:  
His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day; (for he who is hanged is accursed of God;) so that your land may not be defiled, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
