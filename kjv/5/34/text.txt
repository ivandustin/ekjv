And Moses ascended from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah, which overlooks Jericho. The LORD revealed to him all the land of Gilead, extending to Dan,  
And all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, as well as all the land of Judah, reaching to the western sea,  
And the southern region, along with the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, up to Zoar.  
And the LORD said to him, "This is the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you shall not cross over into it."  
So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had spoken.  
He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Bethpeor; but no one knows his grave to this day.  
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eyesight was not dim, nor had his vigor diminished.  
The children of Israel mourned for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; thus, the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.  
And Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the children of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD commanded Moses.  
Since then, no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,  
In all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, and all his servants, and throughout all his land,  
And in all the mighty acts and the great terror that Moses displayed in the sight of all Israel.
