When a man takes a wife and marries her, if she finds no favor in his eyes because he has discovered some uncleanness in her, he should write her a certificate of divorce, give it to her, and send her out of his house.  
Once she has left his house, she is free to become another man's wife.  
If her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, giving it to her and sending her out of his house, or if her second husband dies,  
her first husband, who sent her away, cannot take her back as his wife after she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you must not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.  
When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go to war or be assigned any duties; he shall be free at home for one year to bring happiness to the wife he has married.  
No man shall take either the lower or upper millstone as collateral, for that would be taking a man's life as security.  
If a man is found stealing from any of his fellow Israelites and sells him or makes merchandise of him, that thief shall die, and you must purge the evil from among you.  
Be diligent in observing the regulations regarding leprosy, and follow all that the priests, the Levites, teach you; as I commanded them, so you shall observe and do.  
Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the way after you came out of Egypt.  
When you lend anything to your brother, do not enter his house to retrieve his collateral.  
You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the collateral out to you.  
If the man is poor, you must not sleep with his collateral;  
you shall return the collateral to him by sunset so that he may sleep in his own clothing and bless you; it will be regarded as righteousness before the LORD your God.  
You must not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your fellow Israelites or a foreigner residing in your land within your gates.  
You shall give him his wages on the same day; do not let the sun go down on it, for he is poor and depends on it; otherwise, he may cry out against you to the LORD, and it will be considered a sin for you.  
Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; each person shall be put to death for their own sin.  
You must not distort justice for the foreigner or the fatherless, nor take a widow's garment as collateral.  
Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore, I command you to do this.  
When you harvest your field and forget a sheaf in the field, do not go back to get it; it shall be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.  
When you beat your olive trees, do not go over the branches again; it shall be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.  
When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean it afterward; it shall be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.  
And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore, I command you to do this.
