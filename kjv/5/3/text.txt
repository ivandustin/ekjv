We then turned and ascended the path to Bashan, where Og, the king of Bashan, confronted us with all his people for battle at Edrei.  
The LORD instructed me, "Do not fear him, for I will hand him, his people, and his land over to you; you shall treat him as you did Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who resided in Heshbon."  
Thus, the LORD our God delivered Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands, and we struck him down until no one remained.  
At that time, we captured all his cities; there was not a single city we did not take from themâ€”sixty cities in total, all within the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  
All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great number of unwalled towns.  
We completely destroyed them, just as we did to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, annihilating every man, woman, and child in each city.  
However, we took all the livestock and the spoils of the cities as plunder for ourselves.  
At that time, we seized from the two kings of the Amorites the land on this side of the Jordan, from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon;  
(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Shenir by the Amorites.)  
We took all the cities of the plain, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan, including Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  
Og, the king of Bashan, was the last of the remnant of giants; behold, his bed was made of iron. Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? Its length was nine cubits, and its width was four cubits, according to the measure of a man.  
The land we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the river Arnon and half of Mount Gilead, along with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.  
The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, which is the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all of Bashan, was known as the land of giants.  
Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the territory of Argob to the borders of Geshuri and Maachathi, and he named them Bashanhavothjair, a name that remains to this day.  
I assigned Gilead to Machir.  
To the Reubenites and Gadites, I granted land from Gilead to the river Arnon, half the valley, and the border to the river Jabbok, which is the boundary of the children of Ammon;  
The plain, the Jordan, and its coastline, from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Plain, which is the Salt Sea, under Ashdothpisgah to the east.  
At that time, I commanded you, saying, "The LORD your God has given you this land to possess; you shall cross over armed before your fellow Israelites, all who are fit for battle."  
But your wives, children, and livestock (for I know you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities I have given you;  
Until the LORD grants rest to your brothers, just as He has to you, and until they also possess the land that the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan; then each of you may return to your own possession, which I have given you.  
I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "You have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; He will do the same to all the kingdoms you encounter."  
Do not fear them, for the LORD your God will fight for you.  
I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,  
"O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform according to Your works and according to Your might?  
I ask You, let me cross over and see the good land that lies beyond the Jordan, that beautiful mountain and Lebanon."  
But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen; He said to me, "Enough! Do not speak to Me of this matter again.  
Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift your eyes westward, northward, southward, and eastward, and behold it with your own eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.  
But charge Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across, and he will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."  
So we remained in the valley opposite Bethpeor.
