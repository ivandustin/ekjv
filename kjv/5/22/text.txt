You shall not ignore your brother's ox or sheep if they go astray; you must return them to your brother without fail.
If your brother is not nearby, or if you do not know him, you shall bring the lost animal to your own home and keep it until your brother comes looking for it; then you shall return it to him.
In the same way, you must do with his donkey, his clothing, and any lost property of your brother's that you find; you must not hide from your responsibility.
You shall not turn away if you see your brother's donkey or ox fall on the road; you must help him lift it up again.
A woman must not wear clothing that belongs to a man, nor should a man wear a woman's garment; for anyone who does so is an abomination to the LORD your God.
If you come across a bird's nest on your way, whether in a tree or on the ground, with the mother bird sitting on the young or the eggs, you must not take the mother with the young.
Instead, you must let the mother go and take the young for yourself, so that it may go well with you and you may prolong your days.
When you build a new house, you must make a railing for your roof, so that you do not bring blood upon your house if someone falls from it.
You shall not plant your vineyard with different seeds, lest the produce of your seed and the fruit of your vineyard be defiled.
You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
You shall not wear garments made of different materials, such as wool and linen mixed together.
You shall make fringes on the four corners of your garment with which you cover yourself.
If a man takes a wife and has relations with her, but then comes to hate her,
And gives reasons to speak against her, bringing a bad name upon her by saying, "I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a virgin,"
Then the father and mother of the young woman shall bring forth the tokens of her virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
The father of the young woman shall say to the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, and he hates her;
And behold, he has given reasons to speak against her, saying, 'I found your daughter not a virgin,' and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity." They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
The elders of that city shall take that man and punish him;
They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not divorce her all his days.
But if this accusation is true, and the tokens of virginity are not found for the young woman,
Then they shall bring the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death, because she has committed folly in Israel by being promiscuous in her father's house; thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
If a man is found lying with a woman who is married to another man, both the man and the woman shall be put to death; thus you shall remove evil from Israel.
If a virgin who is betrothed to a man is found by another man in the city and has relations with her,
Then you shall bring them both to the gate of that city and stone them to death; the young woman, because she did not cry out for help in the city, and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife; thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the field and forces her, and lies with her, only the man who lay with her shall die.
But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no sin deserving of death; for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, so is this matter:
For he found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.
If a man finds a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,
Then the man who lay with her shall give the young woman's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not divorce her all his days.
A man shall not take his father's wife, nor uncover his father's nakedness.
