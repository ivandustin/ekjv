You are the children of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.  
For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a special people for Himself, above all the nations on the earth.  
You shall not eat any abominable thing.  
These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,  
the deer, the roebuck, the fallow deer, the wild goat, the pygarg, the wild ox, and the chamois.  
And every animal that has a split hoof, is cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the animals, you may eat.  
However, these you shall not eat from those that chew the cud or have split hooves: the camel, the hare, and the coney; for they chew the cud but do not have split hooves; therefore, they are unclean to you.  
And the pig, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.  
These you may eat from all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales you may eat.  
And whatever does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean to you.  
Of all clean birds, you may eat.  
But these are the ones you shall not eat: the eagle, the ossifrage, and the osprey,  
and the glede, the kite, and the vulture after its kind,  
and every raven after its kind,  
and the owl, the night hawk, the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind,  
the little owl, the great owl, and the swan,  
and the pelican, the gier eagle, and the cormorant,  
and the stork, the heron after her kind, the lapwing, and the bat.  
And every flying insect is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.  
But of all clean birds, you may eat.  
You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you shall give it to the stranger who is in your gates, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to an alien; for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its motherâ€™s milk.  
You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed that the field produces year by year.  
And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.  
And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it; or if the place is too far from you, which the LORD your God shall choose to set His name there, when the LORD your God has blessed you:  
Then you shall convert it to money, and bind up the money in your hand, and go to the place which the LORD your God shall choose:  
And you shall spend that money for whatever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul desires; and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household,  
and the Levite who is within your gates; you shall not forsake him, for he has no part nor inheritance with you.  
At the end of three years, you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and lay it up within your gates:  
And the Levite (because he has no part nor inheritance with you), and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates, shall come and eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
