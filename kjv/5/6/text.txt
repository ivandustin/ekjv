Here are the edited lines:

Now these are the commandments, statutes, and judgments that the LORD your God commanded you to teach, so that you may observe them in the land you are about to possess.  
That you may fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and commandments, which I command you, your son, and your grandson, all the days of your life, so that your days may be prolonged.  
Hear, therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do it, that it may go well with you, and that you may greatly increase, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.  
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD.  
And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.  
These words, which I command you today, shall be in your heart.  
You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.  
You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  
You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.  
And it shall be, when the LORD your God has brought you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities that you did not build,  
And houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and wells dug that you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant; when you have eaten and are full,  
Then beware lest you forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.  
You shall fear the LORD your God, serve Him, and swear by His name.  
You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;  
(For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and He destroy you from the face of the earth.  
You shall not tempt the LORD your God, as you tempted Him at Massah.  
You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, His testimonies, and His statutes, which He has commanded you.  
And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to your fathers.  
To cast out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.  
And when your son asks you in the future, saying, "What do the testimonies, statutes, and judgments mean which the LORD our God has commanded you?"  
Then you shall say to your son, "We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt, and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  
And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and terrible, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes.  
And He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore to our fathers.  
And the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is this day.  
And it shall be our righteousness if we are careful to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as He has commanded us.
