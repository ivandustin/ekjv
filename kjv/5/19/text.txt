When the LORD your God has removed the nations whose land He is giving you, and you take possession of their cities and houses;  
You shall set aside three cities in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God is giving you to possess.  
You shall prepare a road and divide the territory of your land, which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, into three parts, so that every slayer may flee there.  
And this is the case of the slayer who flees there to live: Whoever kills their neighbor unintentionally, without having hated them in the past;  
As when a person goes into the woods with their neighbor to chop wood, and their hand accidentally slips with the axe and strikes their neighbor, causing their death; they shall flee to one of those cities and live.  
Lest the avenger of blood pursue the slayer while their heart is hot, and overtake them on the long way, and kill them; whereas they were not deserving of death, since they did not hate them in the past.  
Therefore, I command you to set aside three cities for yourself.  
And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land He promised to your ancestors;  
If you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you today, to love the LORD your God and to walk in His ways; then you shall add three more cities for yourself, in addition to these three.  
So that innocent blood may not be shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus guilt of bloodshed will not be upon you.  
But if anyone hates their neighbor, lies in wait for them, rises up against them, and strikes them mortally so that they die, and flees to one of these cities;  
Then the elders of their city shall send and bring them from there, and deliver them into the hand of the avenger of blood, so that they may die.  
You shall not show pity to them, but you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may go well with you.  
You shall not move your neighbor's boundary marker, which was set by previous generations in your inheritance, which you will inherit in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.  
A single witness shall not rise up against a person for any wrongdoing or sin; the matter shall be established at the testimony of two or three witnesses.  
If a false witness rises up against any person to testify against them falsely;  
Then both parties involved in the dispute shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in those days;  
And the judges shall make a thorough investigation: and if the witness is found to be a false witness who has testified falsely against their brother;  
Then you shall do to them as they intended to do to their brother: thus you shall purge the evil from among you.  
And those who remain shall hear and fear, and shall no longer commit any such evil among you.  
And you shall not show pity; but life shall be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
