At that time, the LORD instructed me to carve two stone tablets similar to the first ones and to ascend the mountain to Him, while also making an ark of wood.  
I will inscribe on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets, which you broke, and you shall place them in the ark.  
I crafted an ark from acacia wood and carved two stone tablets like the first ones, then ascended the mountain with the tablets in my hands.  
He wrote on the tablets, mirroring the original inscription, the ten commandments that the LORD spoke to you from the fire on the mountain during the assembly, and the LORD gave them to me.  
I turned and descended from the mountain, placing the tablets in the ark I had made; and there they remain, as the LORD commanded me.  
The children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera, where Aaron died and was buried; Eleazar, his son, took over the priestly duties in his place.  
From there, they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land abundant in rivers.  
At that time, the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to bless in His name, as they do to this day.  
Therefore, Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God promised him.  
I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, just as before; the LORD listened to me then as well and chose not to destroy you.  
The LORD commanded me, "Arise, take your journey before the people so they may enter and possess the land I swore to give their ancestors."  
And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you, except to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and soul?  
To observe the commandments of the LORD and His statutes, which I command you today for your own good?  
Behold, the heavens and the highest heavens belong to the LORD your God, as does the earth and everything in it.  
The LORD delighted in your ancestors to love them, and He chose their descendants, you, above all nations, as it is today.  
Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart and be no longer stubborn.  
For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, a great, mighty, and awesome God who shows no favoritism and takes no bribes.  
He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the foreigner by providing them with food and clothing.  
Therefore, love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  
You shall fear the LORD your God; Him you shall serve, and to Him you shall hold fast and swear by His name.  
He is your praise, and He is your God, who has performed for you these great and awe-inspiring deeds that your eyes have witnessed.  
Your ancestors went down to Egypt with seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
