These are now the leaders of their families, and this is the genealogy of those who accompanied me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes.  
Of the descendants of Phinehas: Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar: Daniel; of the descendants of David: Hattush.  
From the descendants of Shechaniah, of the descendants of Pharosh: Zechariah; and with him were counted by genealogy one hundred and fifty males.  
From the descendants of Pahathmoab: Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.  
From the descendants of Shechaniah: the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.  
From the descendants of Adin: Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.  
From the descendants of Elam: Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.  
From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.  
From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.  
From the descendants of Shelomith: the son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males.  
From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.  
From the descendants of Azgad: Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred and ten males.  
From the last descendants of Adonikam, whose names are Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.  
From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.  
I gathered them together at the river that flows to Ahava; and we camped there for three days. I examined the people and the priests, and found no descendants of Levi among them.  
Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan again, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding.  
I sent them with a command to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, instructing them what to say to Iddo and his brethren, the Nethinims, at Casiphia, to bring us ministers for the house of our God.  
By the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, from the descendants of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, eighteen in total;  
And Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty in total;  
Also from the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were listed by name.  
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, to humble ourselves before our God, seeking a right way for us, our little ones, and all our possessions.  
For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on the way, because we had told the king, "The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him; but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him."  
So we fasted and prayed to our God for this, and He was attentive to our plea.  
Then I set apart twelve of the chief priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,  
And I weighed out to them the silver, gold, and vessels, the offerings for the house of our God, which the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel present had offered:  
I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred talents of silver vessels, and one hundred talents of gold;  
Also twenty gold basins, worth a thousand drams each; and two vessels of fine copper, as precious as gold.  
I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy as well; and the silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.  
Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests, Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."  
So the priests and Levites took the weight of the silver, gold, and vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.  
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, heading to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from those who lay in wait along the way.  
We arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.  
On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God by Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;  
They counted and weighed everything, and all the weights were recorded at that time.  
The children of those who had been carried away, who had come out of captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering; all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.  
They delivered the king's orders to the king's lieutenants and to the governors on this side of the river, and they supported the people and the house of God.
