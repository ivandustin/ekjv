Then the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel.  
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God in Jerusalem, assisted by the prophets of God.  
At the same time, Tatnai, the governor on this side of the river, along with Shetharboznai and their companions, approached them and asked, "Who has commanded you to build this house and to restore this wall?"  
We responded by asking them, "What are the names of the men who are overseeing this building?"  
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so they could not stop them until the matter was brought before Darius, who then responded with a letter regarding this issue.  
Here is the copy of the letter that Tatnai, the governor on this side of the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions, the Apharsachites, sent to King Darius:  
They sent a letter to him, which stated: "To Darius the king, greetings."  
Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with large stones and timber laid in the walls; this work is progressing rapidly and is thriving in their hands.  
We then asked those elders, "Who commanded you to build this house and to restore these walls?"  
We also inquired about their names to inform you, so we could write down the names of the men who are in charge.  
They replied, "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago by a great king of Israel."  
However, after our ancestors provoked the God of heaven to anger, He handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and exiled the people to Babylon.  
In the first year of Cyrus, the king of Babylon, he issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.  
The gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon, were returned by King Cyrus to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed as governor.  
He instructed him, "Take these vessels, go, carry them to the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place."  
Then Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem; since that time, it has been under construction, but it is still not finished.  
Now, if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the king's treasury in Babylon to see if a decree was indeed issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem, and let the king inform us of his decision regarding this matter.
