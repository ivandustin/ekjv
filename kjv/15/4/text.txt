Now, when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding the temple for the LORD God of Israel,  
They approached Zerubbabel and the leaders of the families, saying, "Let us join you in building, for we seek your God just as you do; we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who brought us here."  
However, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders of Israel replied, "You have no part with us in building a house for our God; we alone will build for the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us."  
Then the local people weakened the resolve of the people of Judah and troubled them in their building efforts,  
And they hired advisors against them to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, and even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.  
During the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.  
In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their companions wrote to King Artaxerxes of Persia; the letter was written in the Syrian language and translated into Syrian.  
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe sent a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, stating:  
"Rehum the chancellor, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions—the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites—  
And the other nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the others on this side of the river, at such a time."  
This is a copy of the letter they sent to him, to King Artaxerxes: "Your servants, the men on this side of the river, at such a time.  
Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem, rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city, and have restored its walls and joined its foundations.  
Let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls restored, they will not pay tribute, toll, or customs, and this will damage the revenue of the kings."  
Since we receive support from the king's palace, it is not appropriate for us to see the king's dishonor; therefore, we have sent and informed the king.  
Let a search be made in the records of your ancestors, and you will find in the records that this city has been a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that it has a history of sedition; for this reason, this city was destroyed.  
We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls restored, you will have no share on this side of the river.  
Then the king sent a response to Rehum the chancellor, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions dwelling in Samaria, and to those beyond the river: "Peace, and at such a time."  
The letter you sent to us has been read clearly before me.  
I commanded that a search be made, and it was found that this city has a long history of insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have occurred there.  
Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the lands beyond the river; tribute, toll, and customs were paid to them.  
Now, you are to issue a command to make these men stop, and that this city is not to be rebuilt until I give another command.  
Take care not to neglect this matter; why should damage grow to the detriment of the kings?  
When the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they hurried to Jerusalem and forced the Jews to cease their work by power and might.  
Thus, the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a halt, and it remained so until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia.
