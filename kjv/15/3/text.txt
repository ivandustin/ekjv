And when the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel were settled in their cities, the people united as one in Jerusalem.
Then Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, along with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, stood up to build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as prescribed in the law of Moses, the man of God.
They established the altar on its foundations; for they were afraid of the surrounding peoples, and they offered burnt offerings to the LORD, including morning and evening sacrifices.
They also observed the feast of tabernacles, as instructed, and offered the daily burnt offerings in accordance with the established customs, fulfilling the requirements of each day.
Afterward, they presented the continual burnt offerings, including those for the new moons and all the appointed feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, as well as any freewill offerings made willingly to the LORD.
From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, although the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not yet been laid.
They also provided funds to the masons and carpenters, as well as food, drink, and oil to the people of Zidon and Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the port of Joppa, in accordance with the decree they had received from Cyrus, king of Persia.
In the second year of their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, during the second month, Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, along with the remaining priests and Levites, and all who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem, appointed the Levites, aged twenty and older, to oversee the work on the house of the LORD.
Then Jeshua, along with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, and the sons of Judah, gathered together to support the workers in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, along with their sons and fellow Levites.
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they dressed the priests in their garments with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, following the ordinance of David, king of Israel.
They sang together in unison, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, declaring His goodness and the enduring nature of His mercy toward Israel. All the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, for the foundation of the house of the LORD had been laid.
However, many of the priests, Levites, and elders who had witnessed the first temple wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this temple laid before their eyes, while many others shouted for joy.
As a result, the people could not distinguish between the joyful shouts and the weeping, for the noise of the people was so loud that it was heard from afar.
