Now that these matters were addressed, the leaders approached me, saying, "The people of Israel, along with the priests and Levites, have not distanced themselves from the surrounding nations, engaging in their detestable practices, including those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites."

They have taken daughters from these nations for their sons, resulting in the holy lineage being mixed with the peoples of those lands. Indeed, the leaders and rulers have been the primary contributors to this wrongdoing.

Upon hearing this, I tore my garments and mantle, pulled out the hair from my head and beard, and sat down in shock.

Then, all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me, due to the transgressions of those who had returned from exile; I remained in shock until the evening sacrifice.

At the evening sacrifice, I rose from my state of despair; having torn my garments and mantle, I knelt down and extended my hands to the LORD my God,

And said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have multiplied beyond measure, and our transgressions have reached the heavens.

Since the days of our ancestors, we have been in great transgression up to this day; and because of our iniquities, we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, facing the sword, captivity, plunder, and disgrace, as we experience today.

And now, for a brief moment, grace has been shown to us from the LORD our God, allowing us to escape and providing us a stake in His holy place, so that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little revival in our bondage.

For we were slaves; yet our God has not abandoned us in our bondage but has shown us mercy in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to rebuild the house of our God, to restore its desolations, and to provide us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.

And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,

Which You commanded through Your servants the prophets, saying, "The land you are entering to possess is an unclean land, filled with the filthiness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have polluted it from one end to the other."

Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, and do not seek their peace or prosperity forever, so that you may be strong, enjoy the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children forever.

After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and great transgressions, considering that You, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have granted us such deliverance as this;

Should we again break Your commandments and form alliances with the people committing these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You had consumed us, leaving no remnant or escape?

O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous; for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we stand before You in our trespasses, for we cannot stand before You because of this.
