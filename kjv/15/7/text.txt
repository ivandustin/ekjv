Now, after these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,  
the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,  
the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,  
the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,  
the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the chief priest:  
This Ezra ascended from Babylon; he was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. The king granted him all his requests, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.  
Some of the children of Israel, along with the priests, Levites, singers, porters, and Nethinims, went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.  
He arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.  
For he began his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, according to the gracious hand of his God upon him.  
Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the LORD, to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.  
Now, this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD and of His statutes to Israel.  
Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven: perfect peace, and at such a time.  
I decree that all the people of Israel, along with their priests and Levites, in my realm, who are willing to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you.  
Since you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand;  
And to carry the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,  
And all the silver and gold that you can find in all the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, willingly offered for the house of their God in Jerusalem:  
That you may quickly buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.  
And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and gold, do according to the will of your God.  
The vessels also that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver them before the God of Jerusalem.  
And whatever else is needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, provide it from the king's treasury.  
And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done speedily,  
up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred measures of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing an amount.  
Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?  
Also, we inform you that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them.  
And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people beyond the river, all who know the laws of your God; and teach those who do not know them.  
And whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.  
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:  
And has extended mercy to me before the king, his counselors, and all the king's mighty princes. I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
