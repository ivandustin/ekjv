In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, who made a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and also put it in writing, saying,
"Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has commissioned me to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Who among you of all His people? May his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, to rebuild the house of the LORD God of Israel (He is the God), which is in Jerusalem.
And whoever remains in any place where he resides, let the men of that place assist him with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, in addition to the freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.
Then the leaders of the families of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites, and all whose spirits God had stirred, arose to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
And all those around them encouraged their efforts with silver vessels, gold, goods, livestock, and precious items, in addition to all that was willingly offered.
Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
Cyrus, king of Persia, entrusted them to Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
This is the count of them: thirty gold bowls, a thousand silver bowls, and twenty-nine knives,
thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten silver basins of a second kind, and a thousand other vessels.
In total, there were five thousand four hundred vessels of gold and silver. All these Sheshbazzar brought with him when the exiles returned from Babylon to Jerusalem.
