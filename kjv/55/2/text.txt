Be strong, my son, in the grace that is found in Christ Jesus.  
Commit to faithful individuals the teachings you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, so they can teach others as well.  
Endure hardship like a good soldier of Jesus Christ.  
No soldier engaged in warfare entangles himself in civilian affairs, so he can please the one who enlisted him.  
If an athlete competes for a prize, he does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.  
The hardworking farmer should be the first to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  
Reflect on what I say, and may the Lord grant you understanding in all things.  
Remember that Jesus Christ, descended from David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel.  
I endure suffering as a criminal, even to the point of imprisonment, but the word of God cannot be imprisoned.  
Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.  
This is a trustworthy saying: If we have died with him, we will also live with him.  
If we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us.  
If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.  
Remind them of these things, urging them before the Lord not to quarrel about words, which is of no value and only ruins those who listen.  
Study to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.  
Avoid irreverent and empty chatter, as it will lead to more ungodliness.  
Their message will spread like gangrene; among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,  
Who have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already occurred, thus undermining the faith of some.  
Nevertheless, the solid foundation of God stands firm, bearing this seal: The Lord knows those who are his, and let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  
In a large house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for honorable use, while others are for dishonorable use.  
If anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, and ready for every good work.  
Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.  
Avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife.  
And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, and patient.  
In humility, correct those who are in opposition; perhaps God will grant them repentance, leading them to the knowledge of the truth.  
And they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been captured by him to do his will.
