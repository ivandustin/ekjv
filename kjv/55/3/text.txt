This knowledge also, that in the last days perilous times will come.  
For people will be lovers of themselves, greedy, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,  
Without natural affection, betrayers, false accusers, without self-control, fierce, despisers of those who are good,  
Traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;  
Having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from such turn away.  
For of this sort are those who creep into homes and lead captive silly women burdened with sins, led away by various lusts,  
Always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
Now as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disqualified regarding the faith.  
But they will not get very far: for their folly will be evident to all, as theirs also was.  
But you have fully known my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,  
Persecutions, afflictions, which came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.  
Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  
But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  
But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them;  
And that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.  
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:  
That the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
