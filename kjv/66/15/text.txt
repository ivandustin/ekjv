And I witnessed another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels possessing the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is completed.  
I beheld what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and those who had triumphed over the beast, his image, his mark, and the number of his name stood on the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.  
They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, proclaiming, "Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, O King of saints."  
Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy; all nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have been revealed.  
After this, I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.  
The seven angels emerged from the temple, bearing the seven plagues, clothed in pure white linen, with golden sashes around their chests.  
One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.  
The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power; no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
