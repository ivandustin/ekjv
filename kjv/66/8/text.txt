And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
I saw seven angels standing before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.
Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; much incense was given to him to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
The smoke of the incense, along with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel's hand.
The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it to the earth: there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.
The seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
The first angel sounded, and hail and fire mixed with blood followed, cast upon the earth: a third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
The second angel sounded, and a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea: a third of the sea became blood;
a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a lamp; it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of waters.
The name of the star is Wormwood; a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter.
The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars; a third of them were darkened, and the day did not shine for a third of it, and likewise the night.
I looked and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels who are yet to sound!"
