And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write: These things sayeth He who possesses the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a reputation for being alive, yet you are dead.
Be vigilant, and strengthen what remains, which is about to die; for I have not found your works complete before God.
Therefore, remember how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. If you do not remain watchful, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will arrive.
You have a few names in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
The one who overcomes will be clothed in white garments; I will not erase his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge his name before my Father and His angels.
Let anyone who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write: These things sayeth He who is holy, who is true, who holds the key of David; He opens, and no one can shut; and shuts, and no one can open.
I know your works: behold, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can close; for you have a little strength, have kept my word, and have not denied my name.
Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are not, but lie; behold, I will make them come and worship at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.
Because you have kept the word of my patience, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is coming upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
Behold, I am coming quickly: hold fast to what you have, so that no one takes your crown.
The one who overcomes, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never leave it; I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from my God; and I will write on him my new name.
Let anyone who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans, write: These things sayeth the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot.
So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spit you out of my mouth.
Because you say, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and do not realize that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked:
I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white garments, so that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with salve, so that you may see.
As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore, be zealous and repent.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me.
To the one who overcomes, I will grant the privilege to sit with me on my throne, just as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on His throne.
Let anyone who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
