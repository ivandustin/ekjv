And I heard a powerful voice coming from the temple, instructing the seven angels, "Go your ways and pour out the vials of God's wrath upon the earth."
The first angel went and poured out his vial upon the earth; and a foul and painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image.
The second angel poured out his vial into the sea, which turned to the blood of a dead man, causing every living soul in the sea to die.
The third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
I heard the angel of the waters proclaim, "You are righteous, O Lord, who is, who was, and who is to come, for you have judged in this way."
"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they are deserving."
I heard another voice from the altar say, "Indeed, Lord God Almighty, your judgments are true and righteous."
The fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun, and power was granted to him to scorch people with fire.
People were scorched with intense heat and blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues; they did not repent to give Him glory.
The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was engulfed in darkness; they gnawed their tongues in pain,
And blasphemed the God of heaven due to their pains and sores, yet they did not repent of their actions.
The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings of the east.
I saw three unclean spirits resembling frogs come out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.
For they are the spirits of demons performing miracles, going out to the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them for the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
"Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps their garments, so they do not walk naked and expose their shame."
He gathered them together in a place called Armageddon in Hebrew.
The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air, and a loud voice came from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done."
There were voices, thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake occurred, unprecedented since humanity has been on the earth, so mighty and great.
The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; great Babylon was remembered before God, to receive the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.
Every island fled away, and the mountains could not be found.
A great hailstorm fell upon people from heaven, each stone weighing about a talent; and people blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.
