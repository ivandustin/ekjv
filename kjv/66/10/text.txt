And I witnessed another powerful angel descend from heaven, enveloped in a cloud; a rainbow adorned his head, his face shone like the sun, and his feet resembled pillars of fire.  
He held a little open book in his hand, placing his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.  
He shouted with a loud voice, akin to the roar of a lion; and when he cried out, seven thunders responded with their voices.  
As the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write down their words, but I heard a voice from heaven instructing me, "Seal up the things the seven thunders said, and do not write them down."  
The angel I saw standing on the sea and the land raised his hand toward heaven,  
And swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, declaring that there would be no more delay.  
However, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he begins to sound, the mystery of God will be completed, as He has proclaimed to His servants the prophets.  
Then the voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go and take the open little book from the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and the land."  
I approached the angel and requested, "Give me the little book." He replied, "Take it and consume it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth."  
I took the little book from the angel's hand and consumed it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but as soon as I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.  
He then said to me, "You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
