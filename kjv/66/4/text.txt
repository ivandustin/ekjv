After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven; the first voice I heard was like a trumpet speaking to me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things that must take place after this."  
Immediately, I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.  
He who sat there appeared like jasper and sardine stone, and there was a rainbow around the throne, resembling an emerald.  
Surrounding the throne were twenty-four seats, and upon the seats, I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.  
From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and voices; there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.  
Before the throne, there was a sea of glass, like crystal; in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.  
The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.  
Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were full of eyes within, and they do not rest day or night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."  
Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,  
the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever, casting their crowns before the throne, saying,  
"You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honor, and power; for you created all things, and for your pleasure, they exist and were created."
