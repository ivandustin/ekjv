And after these things, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that the wind would not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.  
Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, possessing the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,  
Saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."  
And I heard the number of those who were sealed: there were one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from all the tribes of the children of Israel.  
From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand were sealed.  
From the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand were sealed.  
From the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand were sealed.  
From the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.  
After this, I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from all nations, tribes, peoples, and languages, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands;  
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"  
And all the angels stood around the throne, along with the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,  
Saying, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen!"  
Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these clothed in white robes, and where have they come from?"  
I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.  
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will dwell among them.  
They shall neither hunger nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat.  
For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
