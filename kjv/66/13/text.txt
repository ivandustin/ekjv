And I stood upon the shore of the sea, and beheld a beast rising up from the waters, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns were ten crowns, and upon his heads was the name of blasphemy.
And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth was like the mouth of a lion: and the dragon bestowed upon him his power, his throne, and great authority.
And I observed one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded; yet his deadly wound was healed: and all the world marveled and followed the beast.
And they worshipped the dragon who granted power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to wage war against him?
And a mouth was given to him, speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was granted to him to continue for forty-two months.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.
And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them: and authority was given to him over all peoples, languages, and nations.
And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
And he performs great wonders, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven to the earth in the sight of men,
And deceives those who dwell on the earth by the means of the miracles which he was granted to perform in the sight of the beast; telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword and yet lived.
And he was given power to give life to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads:
And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.
