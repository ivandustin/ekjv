Then he said to the disciples, "It is inevitable that offenses will come; but woe to him through whom they come!
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Take heed to yourselves: If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him."
And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
And the Lord said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?
Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare my supper, dress yourself, and serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you will eat and drink'?
Does he thank that servant because he did what was commanded? I think not.
So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.'"
And it happened that as he was on his way to Jerusalem, he passed through the region between Samaria and Galilee.
As he entered a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him. They stood at a distance
and lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
When he saw them, he said to them, "Go show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.
One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice,
and he fell at his feet, giving him thanks. He was a Samaritan.
Jesus answered, "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"
And he said to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."
When he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation,
nor will they say, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you."
Then he said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
They will say to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go after them or follow them.
For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man.
They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building—
but on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all.
So will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back.
Remember Lot's wife.
Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it.
I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.
There will be two men in the field; one will be taken and the other left."
And they said to him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together."
