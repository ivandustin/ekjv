And the entire crowd arose and led him to Pilate.
They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation and forbidding tribute to Caesar, claiming that he himself is Christ, a King."
Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered, "You say so."
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the people, "I find no fault in this man."
But they became more insistent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee to this place."
When Pilate heard about Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
As soon as he learned that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad; he had long desired to see him because he had heard many things about him and hoped to witness some miracle performed by him.
He questioned him with many words, but Jesus gave him no answer.
The chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
Herod, along with his soldiers, treated him with contempt, mocked him, dressed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate.
On that same day, Pilate and Herod became friends, for previously they had been enemies.
Pilate, having summoned the chief priests, rulers, and the people,
Said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who misleads the people. Behold, I have examined him in your presence and found no fault in this man regarding the charges you bring against him.
Nor did Herod, for I sent you to him; and behold, nothing deserving of death has been done by him.
I will therefore punish him and release him."
(For it was necessary for him to release one prisoner to them at the feast.)
They all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!"
(Barabbas had been imprisoned for a certain insurrection and murder.)
Pilate, wishing to release Jesus, spoke to them again.
But they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
He said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause for death in him. I will therefore punish him and let him go."
But they insisted with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. Their voices, along with those of the chief priests, prevailed.
Pilate gave in to their demands and sentenced that it should be as they requested.
He released to them the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, whom they had asked for, but he handed Jesus over to their will.
As they led him away, they seized a man named Simon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, and placed the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.
A great multitude of people followed him, including women who mourned and lamented for him.
But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
Two other criminals were also led with him to be executed.
When they arrived at the place called Calvary, they crucified him and the criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.
Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." They divided his garments and cast lots.
The people stood watching, and the rulers with them sneered, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God."
The soldiers also mocked him, coming up to him and offering him vinegar,
And saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."
A notice was written above him in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
One of the criminals hanging there hurled insults at him, saying, "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
But the other criminal rebuked him, saying, "Don't you fear God, since you are under the same sentence?
We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."
Then he said to Jesus, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."
It was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.
The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."
When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.
But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,
(He had not consented to their decision and action.) He was from Arimathea, a town of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
He took it down, wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, where no one had yet been laid.
It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
