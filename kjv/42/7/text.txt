Now, when he had finished all his teachings in front of the people, he entered Capernaum.  
A certain centurion had a servant who was dear to him, but he was sick and near death.  
Upon hearing about Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to him, pleading that he would come and heal his servant.  
When they reached Jesus, they earnestly begged him, saying that the centurion was worthy of having this done for him.  
For he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue.  
So, Jesus went with them. As he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to enter under my roof.  
Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; just say the word, and my servant will be healed.  
For I, too, am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."  
When Jesus heard these words, he marveled at him, turned to the crowd following him, and said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel."  
The messengers returned to the house and found the servant well who had been sick.  
The next day, he went to a city called Nain, accompanied by many of his disciples and a large crowd.  
As he approached the city gate, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, who was a widow, and a large crowd from the city was with her.  
When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said, "Do not weep."  
He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."  
The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.  
A great fear seized all of them, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us," and "God has visited his people."  
This news about him spread throughout all Judea and the surrounding region.  
The disciples of John reported all these things to him.  
John called two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus, asking, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"  
When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to ask you, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'"  
At that very hour, he cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and he gave sight to many who were blind.  
Then Jesus answered them, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.  
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."  
After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?  
What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.  
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.  
This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'  
I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."  
All the people, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's way of righteousness, because they had been baptized by John.  
But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by John.  
Jesus went on to say, "To what then can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?  
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'  
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'  
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'  
But wisdom is proved right by all her children."  
One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.  
A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.  
As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.  
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner."  
Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.  
"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  
Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"  
Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.  
Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.  
You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.  
You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.  
Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."  
Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."  
The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"  
Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
