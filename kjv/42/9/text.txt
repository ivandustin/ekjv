Then he gathered his twelve disciples and granted them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.
He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
He instructed them, "Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor bags, nor bread, nor money; nor should you have two coats each."
"Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart."
"And if anyone does not welcome you, when you leave that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
They departed and traveled through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead;
and by others that Elijah had appeared; and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
Herod said, "I beheaded John; but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see him.
When the apostles returned, they reported to him all that they had done. He took them and went aside privately to a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
The people, when they knew it, followed him; and he welcomed them, speaking to them about the kingdom of God and healing those in need.
As the day began to fade, the twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go into the surrounding towns and countryside to find lodging and food, for we are in a deserted place."
But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They replied, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."
For there were about five thousand men. He instructed his disciples to have them sit down in groups of fifty.
They did so and made them all sit down.
Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
They all ate and were satisfied, and the leftovers were collected, twelve baskets full.
It happened that while he was praying alone, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
They answered, "John the Baptist; but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again."
He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
He strictly warned them and commanded them not to tell anyone this.
He said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised on the third day."
He said to them all, "If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me."
"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it."
"What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?"
"For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory, and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
About eight days after these sayings, he took Peter, John, and James and went up to a mountain to pray.
As he prayed, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.
And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah:
They appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
While he spoke, a cloud came and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
And when the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it to themselves, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, a great crowd met him.
And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Master, I beseech you, look upon my son: for he is my only child.
And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and bruising him hardly departs from him.
And I begged your disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son here.
And as he was still coming, the devil threw him down and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they all marveled at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them, so they did not perceive it: and they feared to ask him about this saying.
Then there arose a dispute among them as to which of them should be the greatest.
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their hearts, took a child and set him by him,
And said to them, Whoever receives this child in my name receives me: and whoever receives me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among you all, the same shall be great.
And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.
And Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him: for he who is not against us is for us.
And it came to pass, when the time had come for him to be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
And sent messengers ahead of him: and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to prepare for him.
But they did not receive him, because his face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.
And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, just as Elias did?
But he turned and rebuked them, and said, You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.
For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
And it came to pass, that as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.
And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and bury my father.
Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but you go and preach the kingdom of God.
And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell who are at home at my house.
And Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
