As he entered the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, they closely observed him.
And behold, there was a man before him suffering from dropsy.
Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
They remained silent. He took the man, healed him, and let him go.
He then asked them, "Which of you, if your donkey or ox falls into a pit, will not immediately pull it out on the Sabbath?"
They could not respond to him regarding these matters.
He presented a parable to those invited, noticing how they chose the best seats, saying to them,
"When you are invited to a wedding, do not sit in the highest place, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him;
And the host who invited both you and him will come and say to you, 'Give this man your place,' and you will begin with shame to take the lowest seat.
But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
He also said to the one who invited him, "When you host a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back and you be repaid.
But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;
And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
When one of those at the table heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."
Jesus replied, "A certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests.
At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'
But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have just bought a field, and I must go see it. Please excuse me.'
Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'
Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'
The servant returned and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'
Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"
Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned to them and said,
"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be my disciple.
And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?
For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,
Saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.'
Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.
In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.
Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
