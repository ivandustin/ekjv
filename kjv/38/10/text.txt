Ask the LORD for rain during the season of latter rain; He will create bright clouds and provide showers of rain for every blade of grass in the field.  
For the idols have spoken emptiness, and the diviners have seen falsehoods, sharing deceptive dreams; they offer comfort in vain: thus, they wandered like a flock, troubled because there was no shepherd.  
My anger was ignited against the shepherds, and I punished the goats; for the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, and has made them like His majestic steed in battle.  
From Him came the cornerstone, from Him the nail, from Him the battle bow, and from Him every oppressor together.  
They shall be like mighty warriors, trampling their enemies in the mud of the streets during battle; they will fight, for the LORD is with them, and the horsemen will be dismayed.  
I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph; I will bring them back to their place, for I have mercy on them: they will be as if I had never cast them off, for I am the LORD their God, and I will hear them.  
The people of Ephraim shall be like mighty warriors, and their hearts will rejoice as with wine; indeed, their children will see it and be glad; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.  
I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; they will increase as they have increased.  
I will sow them among the nations, and they will remember Me in distant lands; they will live with their children and return.  
I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria; I will lead them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and there will be no room for them.  
He will pass through the sea in distress, and He will strike the waves of the sea; all the depths of the river will dry up: the pride of Assyria will be humbled, and the scepter of Egypt will be removed.  
I will strengthen them in the LORD, and they will walk to and fro in His name, says the LORD.
