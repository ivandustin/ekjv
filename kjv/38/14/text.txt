Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, and your spoils will be divided among you.  
For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem for battle; the city will be captured, the houses plundered, and the women violated; half of the city will go into captivity, but the remaining people will not be cut off from the city.  
Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as He did in the day of battle.  
His feet will stand on that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will split in two from east to west, creating a very large valley; half of the mountain will move northward, and half will move southward.  
You will flee to the valley of the mountains, for the valley will extend to Azal; yes, you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. The LORD my God will come, and all the saints with Him.  
On that day, the light will not be clear or dark;  
It will be one day known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but at evening time, it will be light.  
On that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem; half toward the eastern sea and half toward the western sea; it will happen in summer and in winter.  
The LORD will be king over all the earth; on that day, there will be one LORD, and His name will be one.  
The land will be transformed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem; it will be raised up and inhabited in its place, from Benjamin's gate to the site of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.  
People will dwell in it, and there will be no more destruction; Jerusalem will be safely inhabited.  
This will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot away while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.  
On that day, a great panic from the LORD will be among them; each will seize the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise against the hand of his neighbor.  
Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered togetherâ€”gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.  
So will be the plague on the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals in those camps, just like this plague.  
It will come to pass that everyone left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.  
If any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, they will receive no rain.  
If the family of Egypt does not go up and come, they will receive the same plague with which the LORD will strike the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.  
This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.  
On that day, there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD"; and the pots in the LORD's house will be like the bowls before the altar.  
Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holiness unto the LORD of hosts; all who sacrifice will come and take from them, and cook in them; and on that day, there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
