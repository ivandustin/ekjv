And the angel who spoke with me returned and awakened me, like a man who is roused from his sleep.  
He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I have looked, and behold, a golden candlestick with a bowl on top of it, and its seven lamps on it, along with seven pipes leading to the seven lamps that are on top of it.  
There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side."  
So I responded and spoke to the angel who was talking with me, saying, "What are these, my lord?"  
The angel who spoke with me answered, "Do you not know what these are?" I replied, "No, my lord."  
Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.  
Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel, you shall become a plain; and he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!'"  
Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.  
For who has despised the day of small things? They shall rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which roam throughout the whole earth."  
Then I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on the left side?"  
I asked again, "What are these two olive branches that empty the golden oil through the two golden pipes?"  
He answered me and said, "Do you not know what these are?" I replied, "No, my lord."  
Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the LORD of the whole earth."
