On that day, a fountain will be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.  
And it will come to pass on that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will remove the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to depart from the land.  
It will come to pass that if anyone prophesies, his father and mother who brought him into the world will say to him, "You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD"; and his parents will thrust him through when he prophesies.  
On that day, the prophets will be ashamed of their visions when they prophesy; they will no longer wear rough garments to deceive.  
But he will say, "I am no prophet; I am a farmer, for a man taught me to keep cattle from my youth."  
One will ask him, "What are these wounds on your hands?" He will answer, "These are the wounds I received in the house of my friends."  
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my companion, says the LORD of hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; and I will turn my hand against the little ones.  
It will come to pass that in all the land, says the LORD, two-thirds will be cut off and die, but one-third will be left.  
I will bring the one-third through the fire, and refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested: they will call on my name, and I will hear them; I will say, "They are my people," and they will say, "The LORD is my God."
