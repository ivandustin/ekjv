Then I turned and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, a flying scroll.  
And he said to me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width is ten cubits."  
Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole earth: for everyone who steals will be cut off as on this side according to it; and everyone who swears falsely will be cut off as on that side according to it."  
"I will bring it forth," says the LORD of hosts, "and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name; it shall remain in the midst of his house and consume it, along with its timber and stones."  
Then the angel who talked with me went out and said to me, "Lift up your eyes now and see what is going forth."  
And I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is an ephah that is going forth." He added, "This is their appearance throughout all the earth."  
And behold, a leaden weight was lifted up, and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.  
He said, "This is wickedness." He cast her into the midst of the ephah and placed the lead weight on its opening.  
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.  
Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "Where are these carrying the ephah?"  
He said to me, "To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be established and set there on its own base."
