Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may consume your cedars.
Mourn, O fir tree; for the cedar has fallen; the mighty have been ruined: mourn, O oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage has come down.
There is a sound of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory has been ruined: a sound of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan has been devastated.
Thus says the LORD my God: Feed the flock destined for slaughter;
Whose owners slay them and feel no guilt; and those who sell them say, "Blessed be the LORD; for I am wealthy": and their own shepherds show them no compassion.
For I will no longer show pity to the inhabitants of the land, says the LORD: behold, I will deliver everyone into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king: and they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their hand.
And I will feed the flock destined for slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. I took for myself two staffs; one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
I also cut off three shepherds in one month; my soul loathed them, and their souls also abhorred me.
Then I said, "I will not feed you: let the dying die; and let the cut-off be cut off; and let the rest eat each other's flesh."
And I took my staff, Beauty, and broke it in pieces, so that I might annul the covenant I had made with all the people.
And it was broken that day: and so the poor of the flock who were waiting for me knew that it was the word of the LORD.
And I said to them, "If you think it good, give me my price; and if not, refrain." So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
And the LORD said to me, "Cast it to the potter: a goodly price at which I was valued by them." I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
Then I broke my other staff, Bands, to sever the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
And the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd."
For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, nor seek the young, nor heal the broken, nor feed the standing: but he will eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces.
Woe to the idle shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye: his arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
