In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chisleu.  
They sent Sherezer and Regemmelech, along with their men, to the house of God to pray before the LORD.  
They spoke to the priests in the house of the LORD of hosts and to the prophets, asking, "Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself as I have done for so many years?"  
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,  
"Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, did you truly fast for me?'"  
"And when you ate and drank, did you not do so for yourselves?"  
"Should you not listen to the words that the LORD has proclaimed through the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, along with the cities around her, when people lived in the south and the plain?"  
The word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,  
"Thus says the LORD of hosts: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion to one another."  
"Do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the stranger, or the poor; and do not devise evil against one another in your hearts."  
But they refused to listen, turning away and stopping their ears so they would not hear.  
Indeed, they made their hearts as hard as stone, so they would not hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore, a great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.  
As He called out and they refused to listen, so they cried out and I would not listen, says the LORD of hosts.  
I scattered them with a whirlwind among the nations they did not know. Thus, the land became desolate after them, with no one passing through or returning, for they made the pleasant land desolate.
