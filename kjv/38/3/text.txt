And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, with Satan at his right hand to oppose him.
And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"
Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments and stood before the angel.
And the angel answered and spoke to those standing before him, saying, "Take away the filthy garments from him." And to Joshua he said, "Behold, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich garments."
And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the LORD stood by.
And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,
"Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall also govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you places to walk among those who stand here."
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions who sit before you, for they are men wondered at; behold, I will bring forth my servant, the BRANCH.
For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon that one stone shall be seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its inscription, says the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says the LORD of hosts, each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.
