The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel, says the LORD, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.  
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling for all the people surrounding it, when they are besieging both Judah and Jerusalem.  
And in that day, I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all nations: all who try to lift it will be severely injured, even if all the people of the earth gather against it.  
In that day, says the LORD, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and its rider with madness; I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah and strike every horse of the nations with blindness.  
And the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts, "The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the LORD of hosts, their God."  
In that day, I will make the leaders of Judah like a fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; they will consume all the surrounding people, on the right and on the left, and Jerusalem will again be inhabited in its own place, even in Jerusalem.  
The LORD will also save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not exalt themselves over Judah.  
In that day, the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the weakest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.  
And it will come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.  
I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplications; they will look upon me whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son, and they will grieve for him as one grieves for a firstborn.  
In that day, there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.  
And the land will mourn, every family separately; the family of the house of David separately, and their wives separately; the family of the house of Nathan separately, and their wives separately;  
The family of the house of Levi separately, and their wives separately; the family of Shimei separately, and their wives separately;  
All the families that remain, every family separately, and their wives separately.
