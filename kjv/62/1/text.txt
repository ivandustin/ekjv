That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have contemplated, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life;  
(For the life was revealed, and we have witnessed it, and testify to you about that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us;)  
That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.  
And we write these things to you, so that your joy may be complete.  
This is the message we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.  
If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth:  
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.  
If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to purify us from all unrighteousness.  
If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his word is not in us.
