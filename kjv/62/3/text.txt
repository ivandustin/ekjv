Behold, what incredible love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God; therefore, the world does not recognize us because it did not know Him.
Beloved, we are now the children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall become; but we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.
And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
Whoever commits sin also breaks the law, for sin is the breaking of the law.
And you know that He was revealed to take away our sins, and in Him, there is no sin.
Whoever abides in Him does not sin; whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.
Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
The one who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was revealed was to destroy the works of the devil.
Whoever is born of God does not commit sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
In this, the children of God are distinguished from the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.
For this is the message that you heard from the beginning: that we should love one another.
Not as Cain, who was of the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous.
Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers; the one who does not love remains in death.
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
By this, we know love, that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how can the love of God abide in him?
My little children, let us not love in word or talk, but in deed and truth.
And by this, we know that we are of the truth and will assure our hearts before Him.
For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows everything.
Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God.
And whatever we ask, we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do what pleases Him.
And this is His commandment: that we should believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us.
And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in them. And by this, we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.
