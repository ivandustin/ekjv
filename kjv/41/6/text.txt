And he left that place and returned to his hometown, with his disciples following him.  
When the Sabbath arrived, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things? What wisdom has been given to him, that even such mighty works are performed by his hands?"  
Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, Joses, Juda, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us? And they took offense at him.  
But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own home."  
And he could not perform any mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.  
He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then he went around the villages teaching.  
He called the twelve disciples to him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.  
He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bag, no bread, and no money in their belts.  
But they were to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.  
He told them, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place."  
And if any place does not welcome you or listen to you, when you leave, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. Truly, I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.  
So they went out and preached that people should repent.  
They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.  
King Herod heard about him, for his name had become well known. Some said, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."  
Others said, "He is Elijah." Still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets."  
But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead."  
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.  
For John had been telling Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."  
So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him, but she could not.  
Because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When he heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.  
Finally, the opportune time came. On his birthday, Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.  
When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I will give it to you."  
And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask, I will give you, up to half my kingdom."  
She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.  
At once, the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."  
The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.  
So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,  
and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.  
On hearing this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.  
The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.  
Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."  
So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.  
But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.  
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; so he began teaching them many things.  
By this time, it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it’s already very late.  
Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."  
But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take more than half a year's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"  
"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five—and two fish."  
Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.  
So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.  
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.  
They all ate and were satisfied,  
and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.  
The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.  
Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.  
After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.  
Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.  
He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn, he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,  
but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,  
because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid."  
Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,  
for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.  
When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.  
As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.  
They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.  
And wherever he went—into villages, towns, or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
