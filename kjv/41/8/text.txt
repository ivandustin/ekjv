In those days, the crowd was very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
"I have compassion for the crowd, as they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.
If I send them away hungry to their own homes, they will faint along the way, for some of them have come from far away."
His disciples replied, "Where can we find enough bread to feed these people in the wilderness?"
He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven."
He instructed the people to sit down on the ground. He took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they served them to the crowd.
They also had a few small fish, and he blessed them and instructed that they be distributed as well.
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples collected seven baskets of leftover pieces.
About four thousand men had eaten, and he sent them away.
Immediately, he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, seeking a sign from heaven to test him.
He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."
He left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.
The disciples had forgotten to bring bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat.
He warned them, "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
They discussed among themselves, saying, "It is because we have no bread."
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them, "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Is your heart hardened?
Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of pieces did you pick up?" They replied, "Twelve."
"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."
He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
He arrived at Bethsaida, and they brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.
He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, he asked, "Do you see anything?"
The man looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."
Once more, Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village."
Jesus and his disciples went to the towns of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."
Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."
