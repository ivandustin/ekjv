The Pharisees and some scribes from Jerusalem gathered around him.  
When they noticed some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashen hands, they criticized them.  
For the Pharisees and all Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands frequently, adhering to the tradition of the elders.  
And when they return from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. There are many other traditions they follow, such as the washing of cups, pots, bronze vessels, and tables.  
The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"  
He replied, "Isaiah prophesied well about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.'  
In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.  
You disregard the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men, such as the washing of pots and cups; and you do many similar things."  
He continued, "You reject the commandment of God so that you may keep your own tradition.  
For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death.'  
But you say, 'If a man tells his father or mother, "Whatever you might have been benefited by me is Corban,"' that is, a gift, he is free from honoring his father or mother.  
And you allow him to do nothing for his father or mother,  
thus invalidating the word of God through your tradition, which you have handed down; and you do many such things."  
When he called the crowd to him, he said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand:  
Nothing outside a person can defile them by going in; rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.  
If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear."  
After he entered the house and left the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.  
He said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile them,  
since it does not enter their heart but their stomach, and then goes out of the body, thus purifying all foods?"  
He went on to say, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them.  
For it is from within, out of the heart of people, that evil thoughts comeâ€”sexual immorality, theft, murder,  
adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.  
All these evils come from inside and defile a person."  
From there, he got up and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice.  
A woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell at his feet.  
The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by birth; she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.  
Jesus said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."  
She replied, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."  
Then he told her, "For saying this, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."  
When she returned home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.  
Again, leaving the region of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.  
They brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.  
He took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers in his ears, and after spitting, touched his tongue.  
He looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha," which means "Be opened."  
Immediately, his ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak plainly.  
Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone, but the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it.  
They were utterly astonished, saying, "He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
