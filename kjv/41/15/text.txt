And immediately in the morning, the chief priests convened with the elders, scribes, and the entire council, binding Jesus, taking him away, and delivering him to Pilate.  
Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" To which he replied, "You say so."  
The chief priests accused him of many things, but he remained silent.  
Pilate questioned him again, saying, "Aren't you going to answer? Look at how many things they are accusing you of."  
Yet Jesus did not respond, which astonished Pilate.  
During that feast, he would release one prisoner to them, whoever they requested.  
There was a man named Barabbas, who was bound with those who had committed insurrection and murder during the uprising.  
The crowd began to shout, asking him to do as he had always done for them.  
Pilate responded, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"  
For he was aware that the chief priests had handed him over out of envy.  
But the chief priests incited the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead.  
Pilate asked them again, "What then do you want me to do with the one you call the King of the Jews?"  
They shouted back, "Crucify him!"  
Pilate said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"  
So, Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and handed Jesus over to be crucified after having him flogged.  
The soldiers took him away into the palace, known as the Praetorium, and gathered the whole battalion.  
They dressed him in purple, wove a crown of thorns, and placed it on his head.  
They began to salute him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"  
They struck him on the head with a reed, spat on him, and knelt down in mock worship.  
After mocking him, they took off the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him out to crucify him.  
They forced a man named Simon of Cyrene, who was passing by, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.  
They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means "the place of a skull."  
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.  
After they crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots to determine what each should take.  
It was the third hour when they crucified him.  
The charge against him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."  
They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and the other on his left.  
This fulfilled the scripture that says, "He was counted among the transgressors."  
Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "Aha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,  
Save yourself and come down from the cross!"  
In the same way, the chief priests mocked him among themselves, along with the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.  
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Even those crucified with him heaped insults on him.  
At the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.  
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"  
Some of those standing near heard this and said, "Listen, heâ€™s calling Elijah."  
One man ran, filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink, saying, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down."  
Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last.  
The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.  
When the centurion, who stood facing him, saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God."  
There were also women watching from a distance, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome;  
(These women had followed him in Galilee and cared for his needs.) Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.  
Now, when evening had come, since it was the day of preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,  
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  
Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had been dead for some time.  
When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.  
Joseph bought fine linen, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock, rolling a stone against the entrance of the tomb.  
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
