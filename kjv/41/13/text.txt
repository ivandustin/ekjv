As he exited the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Master, look at the impressive stones and buildings here!"  
Jesus replied, "Do you see these magnificent buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down."  
While sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,  
"Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?"  
Jesus began to answer them, saying, "Be careful that no one deceives you.  
Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many."  
"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must happen, but the end is still to come."  
"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows."  
"But be on your guard: they will hand you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues; you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, as a testimony against them."  
"And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations."  
"When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what to say; just say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit."  
"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death."  
"You will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved."  
"But when you see the abomination that causes desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it does not belong (let the reader understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains."  
"Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out."  
"Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak."  
"How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!"  
"Pray that this will not take place in winter."  
"Because those will be days of distress, unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again."  
"If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them."  
"At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it."  
"For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."  
"So be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance."  
"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light."  
"The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken."  
"At that time, people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory."  
"And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven."  
"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near."  
"So also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door."  
"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."  
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away."  
"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."  
"Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come."  
"It’s like a man going away: he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch."  
"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn."  
"If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping."  
"What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"
