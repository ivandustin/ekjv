After two days, the feast of Passover and unleavened bread approached, and the chief priests and scribes plotted how they might secretly arrest him and put him to death.  
However, they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people."  
While in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive spikenard ointment; she broke the jar and poured it on his head.  
Some of those present were indignant and said to themselves, "Why this waste of ointment?"  
"It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor." They murmured against her.  
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.  
You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.  
She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.  
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."  
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him.  
When they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.  
On the first day of unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"  
He sent two of his disciples and told them, "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.  
Wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'  
He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there."  
The disciples went into the city and found it just as he had said; they prepared the Passover.  
In the evening, he arrived with the twelve.  
While they were reclining at the table eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."  
They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one, "Is it I?" Another said, "Is it I?"  
He answered, "It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the bowl with me.  
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."  
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."  
Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.  
He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.  
Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."  
After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.  
Jesus told them, "You will all fall away, for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.  
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."  
Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."  
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today—this very night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."  
But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you." And all the others said the same.  
They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."  
He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.  
He said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch."  
Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him.  
"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."  
He returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?  
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."  
Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.  
When he came back, he found them sleeping again, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.  
Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.  
Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"  
Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.  
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."  
Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.  
The men seized Jesus and arrested him.  
Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.  
"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?  
Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."  
Then everyone deserted him and fled.  
A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,  
he fled, leaving his garment behind.  
They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law came together.  
Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards, warming himself at the fire.  
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so they could put him to death, but they did not find any.  
Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.  
Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony these men are bringing against you?"  
But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"  
"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."  
The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.  
"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.  
Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.  
While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.  
She saw Peter warming himself there. She looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.  
But he denied it. "I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.  
When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."  
Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."  
He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don’t know this man you’re talking about."  
Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.
