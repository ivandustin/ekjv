And they arrived on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gadarenes.  
As soon as he stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him from the tombs.  
This man lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him, not even with chains.  
He had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he tore the chains apart and broke the shackles into pieces; no one was strong enough to subdue him.  
Night and day, he roamed the mountains and the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.  
When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell at his feet,  
Crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me."  
For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"  
He then asked him, "What is your name?" The man replied, "My name is Legion, for we are many."  
He begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the region.  
Nearby, on the mountains, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.  
All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, so we may enter them."  
Jesus gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them, and were drowned.  
The herdsmen fled and reported this in the city and the countryside. People came out to see what had happened.  
They approached Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the demons, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; they were afraid.  
Those who had witnessed it told the others how the demon-possessed man had been healed and what had happened to the pigs.  
Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.  
As he got into the boat, the man who had been possessed begged to go with him.  
But Jesus did not allow him, saying, "Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you."  
So the man went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and all the people were amazed.  
When Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.  
Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came and, when he saw Jesus, fell at his feet.  
He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and lay your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."  
So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.  
Among them was a woman who had been suffering from a bleeding issue for twelve years.  
She had endured much under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.  
When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.  
For she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."  
Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.  
At once, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"  
His disciples answered, "You see the people crowding against you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"  
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.  
Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet, trembling with fear, and told him the whole truth.  
He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."  
While he was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"  
Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue leader, "Don't be afraid; just believe."  
He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.  
When they arrived at the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.  
He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."  
They laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him and went in where the child was.  
He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").  
Immediately, the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished.  
He gave them strict orders not to let anyone know about this and told them to give her something to eat.
