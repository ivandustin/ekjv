And he began to speak to them in parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a hedge, dug a place for the winepress, built a tower, leased it to tenants, and went to a distant country.
At the harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
They seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
Again, he sent them another servant; they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.
He sent yet another; they killed him, and many others; some they beat and others they killed.
Having one son, his beloved, he sent him last to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants said to one another, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
They took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
Have you not read this scripture: "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"?
This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
They sought to arrest him but feared the crowd, for they knew he had spoken the parable against them; so they left him and went away.
They sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to him to catch him in his words.
When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and do not care about anyone's opinion; you teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
Should we pay them or should we not?" But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to look at."
They brought it, and he said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" They said to him, "Caesar's."
Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they marveled at him.
Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him, saying,
"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died, he left no offspring.
The second took her and died, leaving no offspring; and the third likewise.
The seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all, the woman died too.
In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."
Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken."
One of the scribes came, and having heard them debating, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"
Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.
The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
The scribe said to him, "Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He.
To love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
As Jesus taught in the temple, he said, "How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'
David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.
In his teaching, he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces,
the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at feasts.
They devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation."
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and watched how the crowd put money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.
A poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth only a few cents.
Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
They all gave out of their wealth, but she, out of her poverty, put in everythingâ€”all she had to live on."
