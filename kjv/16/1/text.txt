The words of Nehemiah, son of Hachaliah. It happened in the month of Chisleu, in the twentieth year, while I was in the palace at Shushan.
Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah, and I inquired about the Jews who had escaped the captivity and about Jerusalem.
They replied, "The remnant left from the captivity in the province is in great distress and disgrace; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."
When I heard these words, I sat down, wept, mourned for several days, fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.
I said, "I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy for those who love Him and observe His commandments:
Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you day and night for the children of Israel, your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have committed against you; both I and my father's house have sinned.
We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, statutes, or judgments that you commanded your servant Moses.
Remember, I beseech you, the word you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you transgress, I will scatter you among the nations.'
But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even if you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen to set my name.
Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and strong hand.
O LORD, I beseech you, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who desire to fear your name; grant success to your servant today and give him favor in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
