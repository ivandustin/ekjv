In the month of Nisan, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, wine was presented before him. I took the wine and gave it to the king, having never before appeared sad in his presence.

The king asked me, "Why is your face sad when you are not ill? This can only be sorrow of the heart." I became very afraid.

I replied to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city, the resting place of my ancestors, lies in ruins and its gates have been burned down?"

The king then asked me, "What is your request?" I prayed to the God of heaven.

I said to the king, "If it pleases you, and if I have found favor in your sight, please send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors' tombs, so that I may rebuild it."

The king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked, "How long will your journey take, and when will you return?" It pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for my return.

Furthermore, I requested of the king, "If it pleases you, please provide me with letters to the governors beyond the river, so they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.

And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace, the wall of the city, and the house I will enter." The king granted my requests, for the good hand of my God was upon me.

I arrived at the governors beyond the river and delivered the king's letters. The king had also sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.

When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard about it, they were greatly displeased that someone had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

I arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.

At night, I set out with a few men; I did not tell anyone what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and I had no animal with me except the one I rode.

I went out at night through the Valley Gate, past the Dragon Well, and to the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been burned.

I continued to the Fountain Gate and the Kingâ€™s Pool, but there was no room for my animal to pass.

So I went up the valley at night and inspected the wall. I returned and entered through the Valley Gate.

The rulers did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; I had not yet shared my plans with the Jews, the priests, the nobles, or the officials, or anyone else involved in the work.

Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so we will no longer be a disgrace."

I shared with them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me, and the words the king had spoken to me. They responded, "Let us rise up and build!" So they strengthened their hands for the good work.

However, when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian heard about it, they mocked us and despised us, saying, "What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"

I replied to them, "The God of heaven will grant us success; we, His servants, will rise and build, but you have no share, right, or memorial in Jerusalem."
