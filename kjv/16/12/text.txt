Here are the edited lines:
These are the priests and Levites who accompanied Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,
Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their brethren during the days of Jeshua.
Additionally, the Levites included: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who oversaw the thanksgiving, along with his brethren.
Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were stationed opposite them in the watches.
Jeshua fathered Joiakim, who also fathered Eliashib, and Eliashib fathered Joiada.
Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.
During the days of Joiakim, the priests were the leaders of the families: Seraiah, Meraiah; Jeremiah, Hananiah;
Ezra, Meshullam; Amariah, Jehohanan;
Melicu, Jonathan; Shebaniah, Joseph;
Harim, Adna; Meraioth, Helkai;
Iddo, Zechariah; Ginnethon, Meshullam;
Abijah, Zichri; Miniamin, Moadiah, Piltai;
Bilgah, Shammua; Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
Joiarib, Mattenai; Jedaiah, Uzzi;
Sallai, Kallai; Amok, Eber;
Hilkiah, Hashabiah; Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
The Levites during the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were recorded as leaders of the families, along with the priests, until the reign of Darius the Persian.
The sons of Levi, the leaders of the families, were documented in the book of chronicles, even until the days of Johanan, son of Eliashib.
The chief of the Levites included Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua, son of Kadmiel, with their brethren opposite them, to praise and give thanks, as commanded by David, the man of God, ward against ward.
Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were porters assigned to keep watch at the thresholds of the gates.
These were during the days of Joiakim, son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra the priest, the scribe.
At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem, to celebrate the dedication with joy, along with thanksgivings, singing, cymbals, psalteries, and harps.
The sons of the singers gathered together from the surrounding countryside of Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
Also from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages around Jerusalem.
The priests and Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall and appointed two large companies of those who gave thanks, one going to the right toward the dung gate:
Following them were Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,
Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
And some of the priests' sons with trumpets; specifically, Zechariah, son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Michaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph:
And his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God, and Ezra the scribe leading them.
At the fountain gate, which was opposite them, they ascended by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.
The other company of those who gave thanks went opposite them, and I followed them, along with half of the people on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces to the broad wall;
From above the gate of Ephraim, above the old gate, above the fish gate, the tower of Hananeel, the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still at the prison gate.
Thus, the two companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I, along with half of the rulers, was with them:
And the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
And Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly, with Jezrahiah as their overseer.
On that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the wives and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
At that time, some were appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather from the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites, for Judah rejoiced for the priests and Levites who served.
Both the singers and the porters kept the watch of their God, and the watch of purification, according to the commandment of David and Solomon his son.
In the days of David and Asaph of old, there were leaders of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah provided for the singers and porters, each day their portion, and they sanctified holy things for the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them for the children of Aaron.
