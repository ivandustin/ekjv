But speak the things that are fitting for sound doctrine:  
That older men be sober, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in patience.  
Older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to much wine, teachers of good things;  
That they may instruct the younger women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,  
To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.  
Young men likewise, encourage them to be self-controlled.  
In all things, show yourself as a model of good works: in teaching, show integrity, seriousness,  
Sound speech that cannot be condemned; so that those who oppose you may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about you.  
Encourage servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them in all things; not answering back;  
Not stealing, but showing all good faithfulness; so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.  
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,  
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;  
Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ;  
Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for Himself a special people, zealous for good works.  
Speak these things, encourage, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
