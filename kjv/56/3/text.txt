Remind them to be subject to authorities and powers, to obey magistrates, and to be ready for every good work.  
To speak no evil of anyone, to avoid quarrels, but to be gentle, showing all meekness to everyone.  
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.  
But after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward humanity appeared,  
Not by works of righteousness that we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit;  
Which He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;  
That being justified by His grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.  
This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to affirm these things constantly, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and beneficial to people.  
But avoid foolish questions, genealogies, contentions, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and worthless.  
A person who is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject;  
Knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being condemned by their own actions.  
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, be diligent to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.  
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, so that nothing is lacking for them.  
And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary purposes, so that they will not be unfruitful.  
All those who are with me send their greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
