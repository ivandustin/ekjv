Likewise, you wives, be in submission to your own husbands; so that if any do not obey the word, they may be won over without the word by the conduct of their wives.  
While they observe your pure conduct accompanied by reverence.  
Let your adornment not be merely external—braiding the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine clothes;  
But let it be the inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.  
For in the past, the holy women who hoped in God also adorned themselves in this way, being submissive to their own husbands.  
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.  
Likewise, you husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, and as fellow heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.  
Finally, all of you, be of one mind, having compassion for one another, love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous.  
Do not repay evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead bless; because to this you were called, so that you may inherit a blessing.  
For whoever desires to love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from speaking deceit.  
They must turn away from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.  
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.  
And who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?  
But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. Do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled;  
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, with gentleness and respect.  
Having a good conscience, so that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.  
For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.  
For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the Spirit.  
In that state, he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,  
Who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it, only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water.  
This water symbolizes baptism that now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,  
Who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him.
