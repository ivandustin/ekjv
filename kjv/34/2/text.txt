He who shatters in pieces has come before you: maintain your defenses, watch the path, strengthen your resolve, and fortify your power mightily.  
For the LORD has removed the glory of Jacob, as He has of Israel: for the destroyers have laid them waste and ruined their vine branches.  
The shield of his mighty warriors is stained red, the brave men are clad in scarlet: the chariots will blaze with torches on the day of his preparation, and the fir trees will tremble violently.  
The chariots will rage through the streets, colliding with one another in the wide avenues: they will appear like torches, they will race like lightning.  
He will call out to his champions: they will stumble in their stride; they will hasten to the wall, and the defenses will be set.  
The gates of the rivers will be opened, and the palace will be laid bare.  
And Huzzab will be taken captive, she will be led away, and her maidens will accompany her, lamenting like doves, beating upon their breasts.  
But Nineveh has long been like a pool of water: yet they will flee away. "Stand, stand!" they will cry; but none will look back.  
Take the spoils of silver, take the spoils of gold: for there is no end to the treasures and glory from all the beautiful furnishings.  
She is desolate, void, and wasted: the heart melts, the knees tremble, and great pain is felt in all loins, and the faces of all grow dark.  
Where is the den of the lions, and the lair of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, roamed, and the lion's cub, and none made them afraid?  
The lion tore apart enough for his cubs, and provided for his lionesses, filling his lairs with prey, and his dens with spoils.  
Behold, I am against you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will set your chariots ablaze, and the sword will consume your young lions: I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.
