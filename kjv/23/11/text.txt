A rod shall emerge from the lineage of Jesse, and a Branch will sprout from his roots.  
The spirit of the LORD will rest upon him, embodying wisdom and understanding, counsel and strength, knowledge, and reverence for the LORD.  
He will possess quick understanding in the fear of the LORD; he will not judge by mere appearances or make decisions based on hearsay.  
Instead, he will judge the poor with righteousness and defend the meek of the earth with fairness; he will strike the earth with the words of his mouth and slay the wicked with the breath of his lips.  
Righteousness will be his belt, and faithfulness will be his sash.  
The wolf will live alongside the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf will be together, and a little child will lead them.  
The cow and the bear will graze together; their young will lie down side by side, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.  
A nursing child will play near the den of the asp, and a weaned child will put his hand on the viper's lair.  
They will not harm or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.  
On that day, a root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the people; the nations will seek him, and his resting place will be glorious.  
It will come to pass on that day that the LORD will once again extend his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea.  
He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the outcasts of Israel, bringing together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  
The jealousy of Ephraim will vanish, and the enemies of Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will no longer be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim.  
They will soar on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; they will plunder the eastern peoples, laying their hands on Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them.  
The LORD will completely destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; with his mighty wind, he will wave his hand over the river, striking it into seven streams, allowing people to cross on dry ground.  
A highway will be there for the remnant of his people who remain from Assyria, just as it was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
