Thus says the LORD: Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is on the way, and my righteousness will soon be revealed.  
Blessed is the person who does this, and the one who holds fast to it; who keeps the Sabbath free from defilement and refrains from doing any wrong.  
Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The LORD has completely separated me from His people," nor let the eunuch say, "Look, I am just a dry tree."  
For thus says the LORD to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, choose what pleases me, and hold fast to my covenant:  
To them, I will give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.  
And the sons of the foreigner who join themselves to the LORD to serve Him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be His servants—everyone who keeps the Sabbath free from defilement and holds fast to my covenant—  
I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar, for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.  
The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, "I will gather others to Him besides those already gathered."  
Come, all you beasts of the field, come to devour; yes, all you beasts in the forest.  
His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all mute dogs; they cannot bark; they lie down, loving to slumber.  
Indeed, they are greedy dogs that can never have enough; they are shepherds who do not understand; they all look to their own way, each one for his own gain, from his own quarter.  
"Come," they say, "I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be like today, even more abundant."
