And on that day, you shall say, O LORD, I will praise you: though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away, and you have comforted me.  
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he has also become my salvation.  
Therefore, with joy, you shall draw water from the wells of salvation.  
And on that day, you shall say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his deeds among the people, and mention that his name is exalted.  
Sing to the LORD; for he has done excellent things: this is known throughout all the earth.  
Cry out and shout, you inhabitants of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.
