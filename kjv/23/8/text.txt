Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz."  
I appointed faithful witnesses to record this: Uriah the priest and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah.  
I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Mahershalalhashbaz."  
Before the child knows how to say, "My father" and "My mother," the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be taken away before the king of Assyria.  
The LORD spoke to me again, saying,  
"Since this people refuses the gentle waters of Shiloah and rejoices in Rezin and Remaliah's son,  
now behold, the Lord will bring upon them the mighty waters of the river, strong and numerous, even the king of Assyria and all his glory. He will rise over all his channels and overflow all his banks.  
He will sweep through Judah; he will overflow and go over, reaching even to the neck; and the outstretching of his wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.  
Associate yourselves, O you people, and you will be shattered; give ear, all you from distant lands: gird yourselves, and you will be shattered; gird yourselves, and you will be shattered.  
Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; speak the word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.  
For the LORD spoke to me with a strong hand and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,  
"Do not say, 'A confederacy,' to all those to whom this people says, 'A confederacy'; do not fear what they fear, nor be afraid."  
Sanctify the LORD of hosts Himself; let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.  
He will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel, He will be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
Many among them will stumble, fall, be broken, be snared, and be taken.  
Bind up the testimony; seal the law among my disciples.  
I will wait for the LORD, who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for Him.  
Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.  
When they say to you, "Seek those who have familiar spirits and wizards who chirp and mutter," should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the living on behalf of the dead?  
To the law and to the testimony: if they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.  
They will pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it will come to pass that when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward.  
They will look to the earth and see trouble and darkness, gloom and anguish; and they will be driven into darkness.
