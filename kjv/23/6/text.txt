In the year that King Uzziah died, I also saw the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.
Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
And one cried to another, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory."
And the posts of the door shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Then I said, "Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts."
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
And he laid it upon my mouth and said, "Lo, this has touched your lips; your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged."
Also, I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I; send me."
And He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but perceive not.'"
"Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed."
Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered, "Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land is utterly desolate."
And the LORD has removed men far away, and there is a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be eaten; as a terebinth tree and as an oak, whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
