For Zion's sake, I will not remain silent, and for Jerusalem's sake, I will not rest, until its righteousness shines like the dawn and its salvation burns like a lamp.
The Gentiles will witness your righteousness, and all kings will see your glory; you will be given a new name, which the mouth of the LORD will declare.
You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
You will no longer be called Forsaken, nor will your land be called Desolate; instead, you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah, for the LORD delights in you, and your land will be cherished.
As a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you.
I have appointed watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who will never be silent day or night; you who mention the LORD, do not keep quiet,
And give Him no rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.
The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by the strength of His arm, "Surely, I will no longer give your grain to be food for your enemies, and the sons of foreigners will not drink your wine for which you have labored."
But those who have gathered it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who have brought it together will drink it in the courts of my holiness.
Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; clear the path, gather the stones, and lift up a standard for the people.
Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work is before Him."
And they will call them, "The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD"; and you will be called, "Sought out, A city not forsaken."
