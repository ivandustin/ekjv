The Spirit of the Lord GOD rests upon me; for the LORD has anointed me to share good news with the humble; He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom to the captives, and to open the prison doors for those who are bound.
To declare the favorable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn.
To grant to those who mourn in Zion, to provide them with beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness; so that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, for His glory.
They will rebuild the ancient ruins, raise up the former desolations, and restore the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.
Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks, and the children of foreigners will be your farmers and vine dressers.
But you will be called the Priests of the LORD; people will refer to you as the Ministers of our God; you will enjoy the wealth of the nations, and in their glory, you will take pride.
Instead of your shame, you will receive double; and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their inheritance; therefore, in their land, they will possess double; everlasting joy will be theirs.
For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing; and I will faithfully reward their work and establish an everlasting covenant with them.
Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them will acknowledge that they are the seed the LORD has blessed.
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul will be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has wrapped me in the robe of righteousness, like a bridegroom adorned with a crown, and like a bride adorned with her jewels.
For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes what is sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
