The burden of Moab. In the night, Ar of Moab lies in ruins and is silenced; in the night, Kir of Moab is also laid waste and brought to silence.
He has gone up to Bajith and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab will wail over Nebo and Medeba; on all their heads, there will be baldness, and every beard will be shaved.
In their streets, they will wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the streets, everyone will wail, weeping profusely.
Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out; their voices will reach even to Jahaz. Therefore, the armed soldiers of Moab will shout; life will be burdensome for them.
My heart will cry out for Moab; his fugitives will flee to Zoar, a heifer of three years old. They will ascend Luhith with weeping; on the way to Horonaim, they will raise a cry of destruction.
The waters of Nimrim will be desolate; the hay has withered, the grass has failed, and there is no green thing left.
Therefore, the abundance they have gathered and what they have stored up will be carried away to the brook of the willows.
The cry has spread around the borders of Moab; the howling reaches Eglaim and Beerelim.
The waters of Dimon will be filled with blood; for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon those who escape from Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
