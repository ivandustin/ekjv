Behold, the LORD empties the earth, rendering it desolate, turning it upside down, and scattering its inhabitants far and wide.  
And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury.  
The land shall be completely emptied and thoroughly spoiled, for the LORD has declared this.  
The earth mourns and fades away; the world languishes and withers; the proud people of the earth do languish.  
The earth is defiled by its inhabitants, for they have transgressed the laws, altered the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant.  
Therefore, the curse has consumed the earth, and those who dwell therein are desolate; thus, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few remain.  
The new wine mourns, the vine withers, and all the joyful-hearted sigh.  
The sound of tambourines ceases, the noise of rejoicing ends, and the joy of the harp fades away.  
They will not drink wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who consume it.  
The city of confusion lies in ruins; every house is shut tight, leaving no one to enter.  
There is a cry for wine in the streets; all joy has faded, and the mirth of the land is gone.  
In the city, desolation remains, and the gates are struck with destruction.  
When it is thus in the midst of the land among the people, it will be like the shaking of an olive tree, and like the gleaning of grapes when the harvest is complete.  
They will lift up their voices and sing for the majesty of the LORD; they will cry aloud from the sea.  
Therefore, glorify the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the islands of the sea.  
From the farthest corners of the earth, we have heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, "My leanness, my leanness! Woe is me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously; indeed, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously."  
Fear, the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.  
And it shall come to pass that he who flees from the noise of fear will fall into the pit; and he who escapes from the pit will be caught in the snare, for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth shake.  
The earth is utterly broken down; the earth is completely dissolved; the earth is shaken exceedingly.  
The earth will reel to and fro like a drunkard and will be removed like a cottage; its transgression will weigh heavily upon it, and it will fall and not rise again.  
And it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD will punish the host of the high ones who are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth.  
They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be confined in prison; after many days, they will be visited.  
Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders gloriously.
