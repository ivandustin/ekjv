Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are placed upon the beasts and the cattle. Your carriages are heavily laden; they are a burden to the weary animals.  
They stoop and bow down together; they cannot deliver the burden, and instead, they themselves have gone into captivity.  
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, whom I have carried from the womb, whom I have borne from the belly.  
Even to your old age, I am He; and even to gray hairs, I will carry you. I have made you, and I will bear you; I will carry you, and I will deliver you.  
To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike?  
They lavish gold from the bag, weigh silver on the scales, and hire a goldsmith; he makes it a god, and they fall down and worship it.  
They bear him on their shoulders, carry him, and set him in his place; he stands there and cannot be moved. Even if one cries out to him, he cannot answer nor save him from his trouble.  
Remember this, and show yourselves to be men; bring it again to mind, O you transgressors.  
Recall the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me.  
Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that have not yet occurred, saying, "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose."  
Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man who executes my counsel from a distant land: yes, I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have planned it, and I will do it.  
Listen to me, you stouthearted, who are far from righteousness.  
I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay. I will place salvation in Zion for Israel, my glory.
