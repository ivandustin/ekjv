For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, removes from Jerusalem and Judah the support and the sustenance, the complete supply of bread, and the entire supply of water.
The valiant man, the warrior, the judge, the prophet, the wise, and the elder,
The captain of fifty, the respected man, the counselor, the skilled craftsman, and the articulate speaker.
And I will appoint children to be their leaders, and infants shall govern them.
And the people shall be oppressed, each by another, and each by his neighbor: the child shall act arrogantly against the elder, and the lowly against the esteemed.
When a man shall grasp his brother from his father's house, saying, "You have clothing; be our leader, and let this disaster be under your authority."
In that day, he shall swear, saying, "I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: do not make me a ruler of the people."
For Jerusalem is devastated, and Judah has fallen: because their speech and their actions are against the LORD, provoking the gaze of His glory.
The appearance of their faces testifies against them; they openly declare their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to their souls! for they have brought evil upon themselves.
Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them: for they shall enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
Woe to the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the consequences of his actions shall be given to him.
As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, those who lead you cause you to stray and destroy the path you should follow.
The LORD stands up to plead, and stands to judge the people.
The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of His people and their leaders: for you have consumed the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your homes.
What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.
Moreover, the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with outstretched necks and seductive eyes, strutting and swaying as they go, and making a tinkling sound with their feet:
Therefore, the LORD will strike with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will expose their secret parts.
In that day, the Lord will remove the finery of their tinkling ornaments around their feet, and their headbands, and their crescent-shaped ornaments,
The chains, and the bracelets, and the veils,
The bonnets, and the leg ornaments, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
The rings, and the nose jewels,
The changeable garments, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the curling pins,
The mirrors, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet fragrance, there shall be a stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-styled hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a garment of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in battle.
And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground.
