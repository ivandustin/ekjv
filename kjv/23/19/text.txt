The burden concerning Egypt: Behold, the LORD rides upon a swift cloud and will come into Egypt; the idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.
I will set the Egyptians against one another; they will fight each against his brother and each against his neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst; I will destroy its counsel, and they will seek the idols, the charmers, those with familiar spirits, and the wizards.
I will hand the Egyptians over to a cruel lord; a fierce king will rule over them, says the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and dried up.
They will divert the rivers far away; the brooks of defense will be emptied and dried up, and the reeds and flags will wither.
The paper reeds by the brooks, at the mouth of the brooks, and everything sown by the brooks will wither, be driven away, and cease to exist.
The fishermen will mourn, and all who cast a line into the brooks will lament; those who spread nets upon the waters will languish.
Moreover, those who work with fine flax and weave networks will be confounded.
They will be broken in their plans, all who make sluices and ponds for fish.
Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings"?
Where are they? Where are your wise men? Let them tell you now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
The princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have seduced Egypt, even those who are the support of its tribes.
The LORD has mingled a perverse spirit in its midst; they have caused Egypt to err in every work, like a drunken man staggering in his vomit.
There will be no work for Egypt, whether head or tail, branch or rush, to do.
In that day, Egypt will be like women; it will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He shakes over it.
The land of Judah will be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it will be afraid because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which He has determined against it.
In that day, five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts; one will be called, "The city of destruction."
In that day, there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the LORD.
It will serve as a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; they will cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, and He will send them a savior, a great one, and He will deliver them.
The LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day; they will offer sacrifices and oblations; indeed, they will make a vow to the LORD and fulfill it.
The LORD will strike Egypt; He will strike and heal it; they will return to the LORD, and He will be entreated by them and will heal them.
In that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria; the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will serve with the Assyrians.
In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land.
Whom the LORD of hosts will bless, saying, "Blessed be Egypt, My people, and Assyria, the work of My hands, and Israel, My inheritance."
