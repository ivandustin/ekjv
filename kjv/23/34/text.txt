Come closer, O nations, and listen; pay attention, O people: let the earth listen, along with all that is in it; the world, and everything that emerges from it.  
For the anger of the LORD is directed at all nations, and His wrath is upon all their armies: He has completely destroyed them, He has handed them over to slaughter.  
Their dead will also be thrown out, and their stench will rise from their corpses, and the mountains will be drenched in their blood.  
And all the hosts of heaven will be dissolved, and the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll: and all their hosts will fall down, like leaves falling from the vine, and like figs falling from the fig tree.  
For my sword will be drenched in heaven: behold, it will descend upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, for judgment.  
The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is heavy with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.  
And the wild oxen will come down with them, and the bulls with the bullocks; and their land will be soaked with blood, and their dust made rich with fatness.  
For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompense for the dispute of Zion.  
And its streams will be turned into pitch, and its dust into sulfur, and the land will become burning pitch.  
It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever: from generation to generation it will lie desolate; none shall pass through it forever and ever.  
But the cormorant and the bittern will possess it; the owl and the raven will dwell there: and He will stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.  
They will call the nobles to the kingdom, but none will be there, and all her princes will amount to nothing.  
And thorns will grow up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in her fortresses: and it will become a dwelling place for wild animals, and a court for owls.  
The wild beasts of the desert will meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr will call to his companion; the screech owl will also rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.  
There the great owl will make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there the vultures will also be gathered, each with her mate.  
Search the book of the LORD, and read: none of these will fail, none will lack her mate: for my mouth has commanded it, and His Spirit has gathered them.  
And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it to them by line: they will possess it forever, from generation to generation they shall dwell therein.
