The wilderness and the solitary places will rejoice for them; the desert will be glad and bloom like a rose.  
It will flourish abundantly and rejoice with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon will be bestowed upon it, along with the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will witness the glory of the LORD and the magnificence of our God.  
Strengthen the weak hands and steady the feeble knees.  
Say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with recompense; He will come and save you."  
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.  
Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing; for in the wilderness, waters will break forth, and streams will flow in the desert.  
The parched ground will become a pool, and the thirsty land will have springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where they once lay, there will be grass with reeds and rushes.  
A highway will be there, a way, and it will be called the Way of Holiness; the unclean will not pass over it; it will be for those: the wayfaring men, even if they are fools, will not go astray.  
No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous beast ascend upon it; it will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.  
And the ransomed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they will obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
