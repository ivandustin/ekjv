Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
For he shall grow up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground: he has no form or majesty; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering: and we hid our faces from him; he was despised, and we did not esteem him.
Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we considered him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the punishment that brought us peace was upon him; and by his stripes we are healed.
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth: he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living: for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
Yet it pleased the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief: when you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days, and the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
He shall see the labor of his soul, and be satisfied: by his knowledge my righteous servant shall justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoils with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death: and he was counted with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
