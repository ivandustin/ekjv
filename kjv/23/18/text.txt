Woe to the land that is shadowed by wings, which lies beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:  
That sends ambassadors by sea, even in vessels made of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, "Go, swift messengers, to a nation that is scattered and stripped bare, to a people formidable from their beginning until now; a nation measured out and trampled down, whose land has been ravaged by the rivers!"  
All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, take note when he raises an ensign on the mountains; and when he blows a trumpet, listen.  
For the LORD said to me, "I will take my rest, and I will reflect in my dwelling place like the clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."  
For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he will both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches.  
They shall be left together for the fowls of the mountains and the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.  
In that time, a present shall be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people that is scattered and stripped bare, and from a people formidable from their beginning until now; a nation measured out and trampled underfoot, whose land has been ravaged by the rivers, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
