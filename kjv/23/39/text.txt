At that time, Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered.
Hezekiah was pleased with the visitors and showed them the treasures of his house, including silver, gold, spices, precious ointment, all his armory, and everything found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not reveal to them.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They have come to me from a distant country, from Babylon."
Isaiah then asked, "What have they seen in your house?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your ancestors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left, says the LORD.
And some of your descendants, whom you will father, will be taken away; they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good." He added, "For there will be peace and truth in my days."
