Thus saith the LORD: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have cast away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother cast away.

Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or do I lack the power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea; I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink because there is no water, and they die of thirst.

I clothe the heavens with darkness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary: he awakens me morning by morning; he awakens my ear to hear as the learned.

The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away.

I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.

For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore, I shall not be confounded: I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

He is near who justifies me; who will contend with me? Let us stand together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.

Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them up.

Who among you fears the LORD, who obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rely upon his God.

Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who surround yourselves with sparks: walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks you have kindled. This shall you have from my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
