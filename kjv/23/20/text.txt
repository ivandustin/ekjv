In the year that Tartan arrived in Ashdod, (when Sargon, the king of Assyria, sent him,) he fought against Ashdod and captured it;
At that time, the LORD spoke through Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and remove the sackcloth from your waist, and take off your sandals from your feet." So he did, walking naked and barefoot.
And the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia;
So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians as prisoners, and the Ethiopians as captives, both young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks exposed, bringing shame upon Egypt.
They will be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia, their hope, and of Egypt, their pride.
And the inhabitants of this isle will say in that day, 'Behold, this is our hope, to which we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: how then shall we escape?'"
