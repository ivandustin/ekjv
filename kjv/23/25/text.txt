O Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name; for You have done wonderful things; Your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.  
For You have made a city a heap; a fortified city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be rebuilt.  
Therefore, the strong people shall glorify You, and the city of the terrible nations shall fear You.  
For You have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is like a storm against the wall.  
You shall bring down the noise of strangers, like the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the pride of the terrible ones shall be brought low.  
And in this mountain, the LORD of hosts will prepare for all people a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food full of marrow, of well-aged wines refined.  
And He will destroy in this mountain the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.  
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from all faces; and the rebuke of His people He will take away from all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.  
And it shall be said in that day, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation."  
For in this mountain, the hand of the LORD will rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under Him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.  
And He shall spread forth His hands in the midst of them, as one who swims spreads forth his hands to swim: and He shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.  
And the fortress of the high fort of Your walls shall He bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
