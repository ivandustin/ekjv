The burden of the desert by the sea. As whirlwinds from the south sweep through, so it comes from the desert, from a fearsome land.
A distressing vision has been revealed to me; the deceitful trader acts deceitfully, and the plunderer plunders. Rise up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; I have caused all their sighing to cease.
Therefore, my loins are filled with pain; anguish has seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I was bent over at the sound of it; I was dismayed at the sight of it.
My heart raced, and fear overwhelmed me; the night of my pleasure has turned into dread for me.
Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, O princes, and anoint the shield.

And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels; he listened carefully with great attention.

And behold, here comes a chariot of men with a pair of horsemen. He answered and said, "Babylon has fallen, has fallen; and all the carved images of her gods he has shattered to the ground."
O my threshing, and the grain of my floor: what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.

The watchman replied, "The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; return, come."
The burden concerning Arabia. In the thicket of Arabia, you shall lodge, O traveling companies of Dedanim.
The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him who was thirsty; they offered bread to him who fled.
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the severity of war.
For thus the LORD has said to me: "Within a year, as a hired worker counts years, all the glory of Kedar will fail.
And the remnant of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be diminished; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken it."
