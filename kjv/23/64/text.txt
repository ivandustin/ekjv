Oh, that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence.
As when the melting fire burns, causing the waters to boil, make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations may tremble at your presence!
When you performed awe-inspiring deeds that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains flowed down at your presence.
For since the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor have they perceived by ear, nor has the eye seen, O God, besides you, what you have prepared for those who wait for you.
You meet those who rejoice and work righteousness, those who remember you in your ways: behold, you are angry; for we have sinned: in these is continuance, and we shall be saved.
But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags; we all wither like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
And there is no one who calls upon your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of you: for you have hidden your face from us and have consumed us because of our iniquities.
But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
Do not be very angry, O LORD, nor remember iniquity forever: behold, we beseech you, we are all your people.
Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation.
Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned with fire, and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Will you restrain yourself for these things, O LORD? Will you remain silent and afflict us very severely?
