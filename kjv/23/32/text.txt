Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will govern with justice.  
A man will serve as a refuge from the wind, and a shelter from the storm; like rivers of water in a parched land, like the shadow of a great rock in a weary place.  
The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will listen attentively.  
The heart of the impulsive will gain understanding, and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak clearly.  
The wicked person will no longer be called generous, nor will the miser be regarded as bountiful.  
For the wicked will speak wickedness, and his heart will devise iniquity, practicing hypocrisy, and uttering falsehoods against the LORD, emptying the souls of the hungry, and causing the drink of the thirsty to fail.  
The tools of the miser are evil: he devises wicked schemes to destroy the poor with deceitful words, even when the needy speak the truth.  
But the generous will devise generous plans; and by generous actions, he will stand firm.  
Rise up, you women who are complacent; listen to my voice, you careless daughters; pay attention to my words.  
For many days and years, you will be troubled, you complacent women: the harvest will fail, and the gathering will not come.  
Tremble, you women who are at ease; be troubled, you careless ones: strip yourselves bare, and put on sackcloth around your waists.  
They will mourn for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.  
Thorns and briers will grow in the land of my people; indeed, all the houses of joy in the joyous city will be affected.  
Because the palaces will be abandoned; the multitude of the city will be left desolate; the forts and towers will become dens forever, a haven for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks.  
Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is regarded as a forest.  
Then judgment will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.  
The work of righteousness will be peace; and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever.  
My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;  
When hail falls, coming down on the forest; and the city will be low in a low place.  
Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.
