O Israel, return to the LORD your God; for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.  
Take words with you and return to the LORD: say to Him, "Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously; then we will offer the calves of our lips."  
Assyria will not save us; we will not ride on horses; nor will we say any longer to the work of our hands, "You are our gods," for in You, the fatherless finds mercy.  
I will heal their backsliding; I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from him.  
I will be like the dew to Israel; he shall blossom like the lily and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.  
His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like Lebanon.  
Those who dwell in his shadow shall return; they shall revive like the grain and grow like the vine; their scent shall be like the wine of Lebanon.  
Ephraim will say, "What more do I have to do with idols? I have heard Him and observed Him; I am like a green cypress tree. From Me comes your fruit."  
Who is wise? Let him understand these things. Who is prudent? Let him know them; for the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them, but the transgressors stumble in them.
