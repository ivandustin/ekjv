Israel is like a barren vine, producing fruit only for itself; the abundance of its fruit has led to an increase in altars, and the beauty of its land has resulted in the creation of impressive images.  
Their hearts are divided; they will be found guilty: He will dismantle their altars and destroy their images.  
For now they will say, "We have no king, for we did not fear the LORD; what can a king do for us?"  
They have spoken empty words, swearing falsely while making a covenant; thus, judgment springs up like hemlock in the fields.  
The inhabitants of Samaria will tremble because of the calves of Bethaven; the people will mourn over it, and the priests who once rejoiced in it will grieve, for its glory has departed.  
It will also be taken to Assyria as a gift for King Jareb; Ephraim will be filled with shame, and Israel will be embarrassed by its own counsel.  
As for Samaria, her king is cut off like foam on the water.  
The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; thorns and thistles will grow on their altars, and they will cry to the mountains, "Cover us," and to the hills, "Fall on us."  
O Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; there they stood, and the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overcome them.  
I desire to discipline them; the people will gather against them when they bind themselves in their two furrows.  
Ephraim is like a trained heifer that loves to tread out the grain; but I will put a yoke on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim carry the load; Judah will plow, and Jacob will break up the ground.  
Sow for yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your unplowed ground, for it is time to seek the LORD until He comes and showers righteousness upon you.  
You have sown wickedness and reaped iniquity; you have eaten the fruit of lies, because you trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your mighty men.  
Therefore, a tumult will arise among your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Betharbel on the day of battle; the mother was dashed to pieces with her children.  
So will Bethel do to you because of your great wickedness; in the morning, the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
