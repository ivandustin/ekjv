When Israel was a child, I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.  
As they called them, they went away from me; they sacrificed to Baalim and burned incense to carved images.  
I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms, but they did not realize that I healed them.  
I drew them with human cords, with bands of love; I was to them like one who lifts the yoke from their jaws, and I provided food for them.  
He will not return to the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian will be his king because they refused to turn back.  
The sword will remain in his cities, consuming his branches and devouring them because of their own plans.  
My people are determined to turn away from me; though they call to the Most High, none will exalt Him.  
How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you like Zeboim? My heart is troubled within me; my compassion is stirred.  
I will not unleash the full force of my anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God, not man; the Holy One among you, and I will not come in wrath.  
They will follow the LORD; He will roar like a lion; when He roars, the children will tremble from the west.  
They will tremble like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria; I will settle them in their homes, says the LORD.  
Ephraim surrounds me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; yet Judah still rules with God and is faithful among the saints.
