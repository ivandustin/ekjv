When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was revealed, and the wickedness of Samaria became apparent; for they engage in falsehoods, and the thief enters, while the band of robbers plunders without restraint.
They do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness; now their own actions surround them; they stand before my face.
They make the king happy with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker, who stops raising the dough after kneading it, until it is leavened.
In the day of our king, the princes have made him ill with bottles of wine; he extends his hand toward mockers.
For they have prepared their hearts like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleeps all night; in the morning, it burns like a blazing fire.
They are all as hot as an oven and have consumed their judges; all their kings have fallen: there is none among them who calls out to me.
Ephraim has mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake that has not been turned.
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he is unaware of it; yes, gray hairs are appearing here and there upon him, yet he does not know.
And the pride of Israel testifies against him; they do not return to the LORD their God, nor do they seek him despite all this.
Ephraim is also like a senseless dove without a heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
When they go, I will spread my net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the air; I will discipline them, as their congregation has heard.
Woe to them! For they have fled from me; destruction is upon them! Because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, they have spoken lies against me.
And they have not cried out to me with their hearts when they howled upon their beds; they gather for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, they still plot mischief against me.
They return, but not to the Most High; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword because of the fury of their tongue; this shall be their ridicule in the land of Egypt.
