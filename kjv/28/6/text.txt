Come, let us return to the LORD; for He has torn us, and He will heal us; He has struck us down, and He will bind us up.  
After two days, He will revive us; on the third day, He will raise us up, and we shall live in His presence.  
Then we will know, if we pursue to know the LORD; His coming is as certain as the morning, and He will come to us like the rain, like the spring and autumn rains upon the earth.  
O Ephraim, what shall I do with you? O Judah, what shall I do with you? For your goodness is like a morning cloud, and like the early dew, it vanishes away.  
Therefore, I have cut them down by the prophets; I have slain them with the words of My mouth; and your judgments are like the light that shines forth.  
For I desire mercy, not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.  
But they, like men, have broken the covenant; there they have dealt treacherously against Me.  
Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity, and it is stained with blood.  
And just as bands of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder on the way by consent; for they commit wickedness.  
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the unfaithfulness of Ephraim; Israel is defiled.  
Also, O Judah, He has set a harvest for you, when I restored the fortunes of My people.
