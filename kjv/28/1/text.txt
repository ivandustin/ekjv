The word of the LORD came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
This marks the beginning of the word of the LORD through Hosea. The LORD instructed Hosea to take a wife of promiscuity and have children of promiscuity, for the land has committed great unfaithfulness, turning away from the LORD.
Hosea obeyed and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.
The LORD commanded him to name the child Jezreel, for in a little while, He would avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu and bring an end to the kingdom of Israel.
On that day, the LORD declared, He would break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
Gomer conceived again and bore a daughter. God instructed Hosea to name her Loruhamah, for He would no longer show mercy to the house of Israel but would completely remove them.
However, He would show mercy to the house of Judah, saving them by the LORD their God, and not by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.
After weaning Loruhamah, Gomer conceived again and bore a son.
God told Hosea to name him Loammi, for the people were not His, and He would not be their God.
Yet, the number of the children of Israel would be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted; and in the place where it was said to them, "You are not my people," it would be declared, "You are the sons of the living God."
Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel would be gathered together, appointing one leader, and they would rise from the land, for the day of Jezreel would be great.
