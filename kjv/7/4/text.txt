The children of Israel once again committed evil in the sight of the LORD after the death of Ehud.
The LORD allowed them to fall into the hands of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor; his army's commander was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
The children of Israel cried out to the LORD, for he had nine hundred iron chariots and had severely oppressed them for twenty years.
Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
She lived under the palm tree of Deborah, located between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel came to her for judgment.
She sent for Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, "Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded you to go and gather at Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun?
I will lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and troops, to the river Kishon and give him into your hands."
Barak replied, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go."
She answered, "Certainly, I will go with you; however, the journey you are taking will not bring you glory, for the LORD will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman." Deborah then arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he marched up with ten thousand men at his feet, with Deborah accompanying him.
Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the plain of Zaanaim, close to Kedesh.
They informed Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.
Sisera gathered all his chariots, including nine hundred iron chariots, and all his troops, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river Kishon.
Deborah said to Barak, "Get up, for this is the day the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hands. Is not the LORD going ahead of you?" So Barak descended from Mount Tabor, followed by ten thousand men.
The LORD routed Sisera, his chariots, and his entire army before Barak; Sisera leaped from his chariot and fled on foot.
Barak pursued the chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all of Sisera's troops fell by the sword; not a single man was left.
However, Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; do not be afraid." When he turned in to her tent, she covered him with a blanket.
He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.
He then said to her, "Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, 'Is there anyone here?' say, 'No.'"
Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand, quietly approached him, and drove the peg through his temple into the ground, for he was fast asleep and exhausted. So he died.
As Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said, "Come, I will show you the man you are looking for." When he entered her tent, he saw Sisera lying dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
So on that day, God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the children of Israel.
The children of Israel pressed on and prevailed against Jabin, the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed him completely.
