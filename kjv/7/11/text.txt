Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, and he was the son of a prostitute: Gilead was his father.
Gilead's wife bore him sons; as his wife's sons grew up, they expelled Jephthah, saying to him, "You shall not inherit in our father's house, for you are the son of a foreign woman."
Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a group of worthless men gathered around him and went out with him.
After some time, the children of Ammon waged war against Israel.
When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob.
They said to Jephthah, "Come, be our commander, so we can fight the children of Ammon."
Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?"
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "We have now turned back to you, so that you may go with us and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our leader over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
Jephthah asked the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me back to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivers them into my hands, will I be your leader?"
The elders of Gilead replied to Jephthah, "The LORD is our witness; we will do as you say."
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpeh.
Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, asking, "What do you have against me that you have come to fight in my land?"
The king of the children of Ammon responded to Jephthah's messengers, "Israel took my land when they came up from Egypt, from Arnon to Jabbok and to the Jordan. Now, therefore, restore those lands to me peacefully."
Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of the children of Ammon,
saying, "This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the children of Ammon.
When Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness to the Red Sea and arrived at Kadesh.
Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us pass through your land,' but the king of Edom refused. They also sent a message to the king of Moab, but he did not consent, so Israel remained in Kadesh.
Then they traveled through the wilderness, circled the land of Edom and Moab, and came to the east side of Moab, camping on the other side of Arnon, but did not enter the territory of Moab, for Arnon was the border of Moab.
Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, asking, 'Let us pass through your land to our destination.'
But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; instead, he gathered all his people, camped at Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
The LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel, and they struck them down, so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that region.
They took all the territory of the Amorites, from Arnon to Jabbok, and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites before His people Israel, and should you possess it?
Will you not possess what Chemosh, your god, gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God drives out before us, we will possess.
Are you any better than Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them,
while Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon for three hundred years? Why did you not recover them during that time?
Therefore, I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. May the LORD be the judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
However, the king of the children of Ammon did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent him.
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and crossed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he went to the children of Ammon.
Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, saying, "If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering."
So Jephthah crossed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
He struck them from Aroer to Minnith, a total of twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus, the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
When Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpeh, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and dances; she was his only child; besides her, he had neither son nor daughter.
When he saw her, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me, for I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot go back."
She said to him, "My father, if you have made a vow to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the children of Ammon."
She then said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: allow me two months to roam the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my friends."
He said, "Go." He sent her away for two months, and she went with her companions and wept for her virginity on the mountains.
At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did to her according to his vow, and she had never known a man. It became a custom in Israel
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days each year.
