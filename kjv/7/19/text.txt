And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite was sojourning on the side of Mount Ephraim, who took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
And his concubine was unfaithful to him, and went away to her father's house in Bethlehem, where she stayed for four whole months.
Her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back, taking his servant and a couple of donkeys with him; she brought him into her father's house, and when the father of the young woman saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
The father-in-law, the young woman's father, detained him, and he stayed with him for three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there.
On the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, he prepared to depart, but the young woman's father said to his son-in-law, "Comfort your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you may go your way."
They sat down, ate, and drank together, for the young woman's father had said to the man, "Please be content and stay the night, and let your heart be merry."
When the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him, so he stayed there again.
He arose early on the fifth day to depart, and the young woman's father said, "Comfort your heart, I pray you." They lingered until afternoon, and they both ate together.
When the man rose to depart, he, his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young woman's father, said to him, "Behold, the day is drawing to a close; please stay the night. The day is ending; lodge here so that your heart may be merry, and tomorrow you can get an early start on your way home."
But the man would not stay that night; he rose up and departed, and came to Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and he had two donkeys saddled, and his concubine was with him.
As they were near Jebus, the day was far spent; the servant said to his master, "Come, please, let us turn into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it."
But his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger, who is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah."
He then said to his servant, "Come, let us draw near to one of these places to lodge for the night, in Gibeah or in Ramah."
They continued on their way, and the sun set upon them as they were by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
They turned aside there to go in and lodge in Gibeah; and when he went in, he sat down in the street of the city, for no one took them into his house to lodge.
And behold, an old man came in from his work in the field at evening; he was also from Mount Ephraim and sojourned in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.
When he lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city, and the old man said, "Where are you going? And where do you come from?"
He said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the side of Mount Ephraim; I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah, but now I am going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man who will receive me into his house."
"Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and there is bread and wine for me, for your maidservant, and for the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything."
And the old man said, "Peace be with you; however, let all your needs be upon me; only do not lodge in the street."
So he brought him into his house, gave feed to the donkeys, and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
While they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, surrounded the house, beating on the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him."
And the master of the house went out to them and said, "No, my brothers, I beg you, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this folly."
"Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; let me bring them out now, and humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man do not do such a vile thing."
But the men would not listen to him; so the man took his concubine and brought her out to them, and they knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to dawn, they let her go.
Then the woman came in at dawn and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until it was light.
Her lord rose up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman, his concubine, had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.
He said to her, "Get up, and let us be going." But there was no answer. So the man took her up upon a donkey, and he rose up and went to his place.
When he came into his house, he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her, along with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territories of Israel.
And it was so, that all who saw it said, "There has been no such deed done or seen since the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak your minds."
