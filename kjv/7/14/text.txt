Samson traveled to Timnath and noticed a woman among the daughters of the Philistines.  
He returned to his parents and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnath from the Philistines; please get her for me as my wife."  
His father and mother replied, "Is there not a woman among your relatives or among all our people that you would choose a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" Samson insisted, "Get her for me; she pleases me."  
However, his parents were unaware that this was part of the LORD's plan to create an opportunity against the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at that time.  
Samson, along with his parents, went to Timnath and reached the vineyards there, where a young lion suddenly roared at him.  
The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart as easily as one would a young goat, without anything in his hand; he did not tell his parents what he had done.  
He then went down and spoke to the woman, and she was pleasing to him.  
Later, he returned to take her as his wife and diverted to see the lion's carcass, where he found a swarm of bees and honey inside.  
He scooped some honey into his hands and ate it as he walked, then shared it with his parents, but he did not mention that he had taken it from the lion's carcass.  
His father went to meet the woman, and Samson hosted a feast there, as was customary for young men.  
When the guests saw him, they brought thirty companions to join him.  
Samson proposed a riddle to them: "If you can solve it within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.  
But if you cannot solve it, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes." They agreed, "Tell us your riddle so we can hear it."  
He said, "Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet." They were unable to solve the riddle in three days.  
On the seventh day, they approached Samson's wife, urging her to persuade him to reveal the riddle, threatening to burn her and her father's house if she did not. "Did you invite us here to take what we have?" they asked.  
Samson's wife cried before him, saying, "You hate me and do not love me; you have posed a riddle to my people but have not told me the answer." He replied, "I have not even told my father or mother; should I tell you?"  
She wept for seven days while the feast continued, and on the seventh day, he finally told her because she pressed him hard. She then revealed the riddle to her people.  
The men of the city asked him before sunset on the seventh day, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" He responded, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle."  
The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, took their belongings, and gave the garments to those who had solved the riddle. His anger flared, and he returned to his father's house.  
Meanwhile, Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.
