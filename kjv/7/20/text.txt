Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation gathered together as one man, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.  
And the leaders of all the people, from all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword.  
(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpeh.) Then the children of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this wickedness occur?"  
And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was slain, answered and said, "I came to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, with my concubine, to lodge."  
And the men of Gibeah rose against me, surrounded the house where I was staying by night, and intended to kill me; they forced my concubine, and she is dead.  
So I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.  
Behold, you are all children of Israel; give your advice and counsel here.  
And all the people arose as one man, saying, "We will not return to our tents, nor will we turn into our houses."  
But now this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it.  
And we will take ten men from a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to gather provisions for the people, so that they may do to Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly they have committed in Israel.  
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.  
And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What wickedness is this that has been done among you?"  
Now therefore deliver to us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death and remove evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel.  
But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.  
At that time, the children of Benjamin were numbered at twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered at seven hundred chosen men.  
Among all this people, there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling stones at a hair's breadth and not miss.  
And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered at four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of war.  
And the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, saying, "Which of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first."  
And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.  
And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; they arranged themselves to fight against them at Gibeah.  
And the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck down twenty-two thousand men of Israel that day.  
And the men of Israel encouraged themselves and set their battle array again in the same place where they had arranged themselves the first day.  
(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin, my brother?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him.")  
And the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin the second day.  
And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and struck down eighteen thousand men of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword.  
Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up to the house of God, wept, sat there before the LORD, fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.  
And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,  
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin, my brother, or shall I cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand."  
And Israel set ambushes around Gibeah.  
And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day and arranged themselves against Gibeah, as they had done before.  
And the children of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city; they began to strike down the people and kill, as they had done before, on the highways, one going up to the house of God and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.  
And the children of Benjamin said, "They are defeated before us, as in the first battle." But the children of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways."  
And all the men of Israel rose up out of their places and arranged themselves at Baaltamar; and the ambushes of Israel came forth from their hiding places, even from the meadows of Gibeah.  
And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men from all Israel, and the battle was fierce; but they did not know that evil was near them.  
And the LORD struck down Benjamin before Israel, and the children of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of the Benjamites that day; all these drew the sword.  
So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; for the men of Israel gave ground to the Benjamites, because they trusted in the ambushes they had set near Gibeah.  
And the ambushes hurried and rushed upon Gibeah; and the ambushes drew themselves along and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.  
Now there was an appointed signal between the men of Israel and the ambushes, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.  
And when the men of Israel retreated in the battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel; for they said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."  
But when the flame began to rise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.  
And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil had come upon them.  
Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities were destroyed in their midst.  
Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, chased them, and trampled them down easily toward Gibeah, in the direction of the sunrise.  
And there fell eighteen thousand men of Benjamin; all these were men of valor.  
And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned five thousand men from them on the highways, and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and killed two thousand men of them.  
So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.  
But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and stayed in the rock Rimmon for four months.  
And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, as well as the men of every city, the beasts, and all that came to hand; they also set fire to all the cities they came to.
