After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, asking, "Who will go up first to fight against the Canaanites?"  
The LORD responded, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hands."  
Judah then said to his brother Simeon, "Come with me to my territory, so we can fight against the Canaanites; I will also go with you to your territory." So Simeon joined him.  
Judah advanced, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands; they killed ten thousand men at Bezek.  
They discovered Adonibezek in Bezek, fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.  
However, Adonibezek fled, and they pursued him, captured him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.  
Adonibezek remarked, "Seventy kings, with their thumbs and big toes cut off, gathered scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me." They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.  
The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, captured it, struck it with the sword, and set the city ablaze.  
Afterward, the children of Judah went down to battle against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the lowland.  
Judah attacked the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly known as Kirjatharba) and killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.  
From there, he went against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kirjathsepher).  
Caleb declared, "Whoever attacks and captures Kirjathsepher, I will give my daughter Achsah to him as a wife."  
Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it, and Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife.  
When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"  
She replied, "Give me a blessing; you have given me a south land; now give me also springs of water." Caleb granted her the upper and lower springs.  
The descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up from the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, south of Arad, and settled among the people.  
Judah and his brother Simeon attacked the Canaanites in Zephath and completely destroyed it; the city was named Hormah.  
Judah also captured Gaza, its territory, Askelon, its territory, and Ekron, its territory.  
The LORD was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots.  
They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had instructed, and he expelled the three sons of Anak from there.  
The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; thus, the Jebusites live with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.  
The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.  
The house of Joseph sent spies to scout Bethel (formerly known as Luz).  
The spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him, "Show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy."  
When he showed them the entrance to the city, they struck the city with the sword but let the man and his family go free.  
The man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz, which remains its name to this day.  
Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites continued to dwell in that land.  
When Israel became strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not completely drive them out.  
Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; thus, the Canaanites continued to dwell in Gezer among them.  
Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol; the Canaanites lived among them and became tributaries.  
Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, Zidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob;  
the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.  
Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh or Bethanath; instead, he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and Bethanath became tributaries to them.  
The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, preventing them from coming down to the valley.  
However, the Amorites continued to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, and they became tributaries.  
The territory of the Amorites extended from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
