There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Micah.  
He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, which you cursed and spoke about in my hearing, look, the silver is with me; I took it." His mother replied, "Blessed be you by the LORD, my son."  
After he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I had dedicated the silver entirely to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a cast image; now, therefore, I will return it to you."  
Yet he returned the money to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, who made a carved image and a cast image. They were placed in Micah's house.  
Micah had a shrine and made an ephod and household gods, and he consecrated one of his sons to be his priest.  
In those days, there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in their own eyes.  
There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the family of Judah, who was a Levite and was living there.  
The man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a place to stay, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to Micah's house, as he traveled.  
Micah asked him, "Where are you coming from?" He answered, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I can find a place."  
Micah said to him, "Stay with me and be a father and priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your food." So the Levite agreed to stay.  
The Levite was pleased to stay with Micah, and the young man became like one of his sons.  
Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and was in Micah's house.  
Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest."
