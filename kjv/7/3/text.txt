Now these are the nations that the LORD left to test Israel, specifically those among the Israelites who had not experienced all the wars of Canaan.
This was so that the generations of the children of Israel might learn about warfare, especially those who had previously known nothing about it.
These included five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the mountains of Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon to the entrance of Hamath.
They were meant to test Israel to see if they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which He commanded their ancestors through Moses.
The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
They took their daughters as wives and gave their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.
The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served Baalim and the Asherah poles.
As a result, the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of Chushanrishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and the children of Israel served him for eight years.
When the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, He raised up a deliverer for them, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; he went to war, and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hands, and he prevailed against him.
The land had peace for forty years, until Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.
The children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel because they had done evil in His sight.
He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek, went and struck Israel, and took possession of the city of palm trees.
So the children of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, for eighteen years.
But when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, He raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud, the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man; by him, the children of Israel sent a tribute to Eglon, the king of Moab.
Ehud made himself a double-edged dagger about a cubit long and strapped it to his right thigh under his clothing.
He brought the tribute to Eglon, king of Moab, who was a very fat man.
After he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried it.
But he himself turned back from the stone images near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." The king said, "Keep silence!" And all who stood by him went out from him.
Ehud approached him while he was sitting in his cool upper room and said, "I have a message from God for you." The king rose from his seat.
Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly.
The blade went in after the haft, and the fat closed over the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, and excrement came out.
Then Ehud went out through the porch, shut the doors of the upper room behind him, and locked them.
When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they said, "Surely he is covering his feet in the inner chamber."
They waited until they were embarrassed; but when he still did not open the doors of the upper room, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord, dead on the floor.
Ehud escaped while they tarried, passing beyond the stone images and escaping to Seirath.
When he arrived, he blew a trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains, and he led them.
He said to them, "Follow me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands." So they followed him down and took the fords of the Jordan against Moab, allowing no one to cross over.
At that time, they killed about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong and valiant; not one escaped.
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
After him came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; he also delivered Israel.
