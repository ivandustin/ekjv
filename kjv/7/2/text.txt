An angel of the LORD ascended from Gilgal to Bochim and said, "I brought you up from Egypt and led you to the land I promised to your ancestors; I declared that I would never break my covenant with you.
You must not make any agreements with the inhabitants of this land; you must tear down their altars. Yet you have not obeyed my voice. Why have you done this?
Therefore, I also declared that I will not drive them out before you; they will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a trap for you.
When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people raised their voices and wept.
They named that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
After Joshua dismissed the people, the children of Israel went to their respective inheritances to possess the land.
The people served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived him, those who had witnessed all the great works the LORD had done for Israel.
Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten.
They buried him in the territory of his inheritance at Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the hill Gaash.
That entire generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation arose after them that did not know the LORD or the works He had done for Israel.
The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and served Baalim.
They forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt, and followed other gods, the gods of the surrounding peoples, bowing down to them and provoking the LORD to anger.
They abandoned the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who stripped them, and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so they could no longer stand against their enemies.
Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had said and sworn to them; they were greatly distressed.
Nevertheless, the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.
Yet they would not listen to their judges; instead, they went after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned away from the path their fathers had walked, obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do so.
When the LORD raised up judges for them, He was with the judge and delivered them from the hands of their enemies throughout the judge's lifetime, for the LORD was moved to pity by their groanings because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.
But when the judge died, they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, following other gods to serve and bow down to them; they did not cease from their own practices or their stubborn ways.
The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, "Because this people has violated my covenant that I commanded their fathers and has not listened to my voice,
I will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.
I will use them to test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their fathers did."
Therefore, the LORD left those nations, without hastily driving them out, nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
