In those days, there was no king in Israel; during that time, the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in, for up to that day, their inheritance had not been allocated among the tribes of Israel.
The children of Dan sent five men from their family, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it; they instructed them, "Go, search the land." When they arrived at Mount Ephraim, they lodged at the house of Micah.
While they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite and turned in, asking him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?"
He replied, "Micah deals with me in this way; he has hired me, and I am his priest."
They then said to him, "Please inquire of God for us, so we may know if our journey will be successful."
The priest answered them, "Go in peace; the LORD is with you on your journey."
The five men departed and went to Laish, observing the people there, how they lived in security, like the Zidonians, quiet and untroubled; there was no magistrate in the land to shame them in anything, and they were far from the Zidonians, having no dealings with anyone.
They returned to their brethren in Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren asked them, "What do you say?"
They replied, "Arise, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why are you hesitating? Do not be lazy in going to possess the land."
"When you go, you will come to a people who are secure and to a large land, for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no lack of anything on earth."
From there, six hundred men from the family of the Danites, armed for battle, departed from Zorah and Eshtaol.
They went up and camped at Kirjathjearim in Judah; therefore, they named that place Mahanehdan, which remains to this day, behind Kirjathjearim.
They moved on to Mount Ephraim and arrived at the house of Micah.
Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish spoke to their brethren, saying, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, a graven image, and a molten image? Now, therefore, consider what you should do."
They turned toward the house of the young Levite, to Micah's house, and greeted him.
The six hundred armed men from the children of Dan stood at the entrance of the gate.
The five men who had spied out the land entered and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred armed men.
They went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image. The priest asked them, "What are you doing?"
They replied, "Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?"
The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
So they turned and departed, placing the little ones, the cattle, and the carriage in front of them.
When they were a good distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.
They called out to the children of Dan, who turned and asked Micah, "What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?"
Micah replied, "You have taken away my gods that I made, and the priest, and you have gone away; what do I have left? Why do you ask me what is the matter?"
The children of Dan warned him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men attack you, and you lose your life along with your household."
The children of Dan continued on their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
They took the items Micah had made, along with the priest, and went to Laish, a people who were quiet and secure; they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
There was no deliverer because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with anyone; it was in the valley near Bethrehob. They built a city and dwelt there.
They named the city Dan, after their father Dan, who was born to Israel; however, the city was originally called Laish.
The children of Dan set up the graven image, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons served as priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the land's captivity.
They continued to set up Micah's graven image, which he had made, throughout the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
