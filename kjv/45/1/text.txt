Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,  
(Which He had promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy scriptures,)  
Concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh;  
And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:  
Through whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for His name:  
Among whom you also are called of Jesus Christ:  
To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.  
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers;  
Making request, if by any means now at last I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.  
For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;  
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.  
Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you, (but was hindered until now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among other Gentiles.  
I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.  
So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.  
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."  
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness;  
Because what may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has shown it to them.  
For the invisible attributes of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  
Because although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful; but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  
Professing to be wise, they became fools,  
And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.  
Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves:  
Who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  
For this reason God gave them up to vile passions: for even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature:  
Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another; men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.  
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting;  
Being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  
Backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  
Undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful:  
Who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.
