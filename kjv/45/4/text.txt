What shall we say then that Abraham, our father, has found in relation to the flesh?
For if Abraham was justified by works, he has reason to boast; but not before God.
For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
Now to the one who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as a debt.
But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.
Just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,
Saying, "Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not charge sin.
Is this blessedness then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.
How then was it credited? Was it before or after he was circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness he had by faith while still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe, even though they are not circumcised, so that righteousness might be credited to them as well.
And he is also the father of the circumcised, not only to those who are circumcised but also to those who follow in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified.
Because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law, there is no transgression.
Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace, so that the promise might be guaranteed to all his offspring; not only to those who are of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
(As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations") in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did.
Who, against hope, believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was said, "So shall your offspring be."
And without weakening in faith, he did not consider his own body, now dead, since he was about a hundred years old, or the deadness of Sarah's womb.
He did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
Being fully convinced that what He had promised, He was also able to perform.
And therefore, it was credited to him as righteousness.
Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,
But also for us, to whom it will be credited, if we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Who was delivered up for our offenses and was raised for our justification.
