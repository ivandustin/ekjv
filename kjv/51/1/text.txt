Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,  
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,  
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints,  
For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;  
Which has come unto you, as it has in all the world, and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth:  
As you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you;  
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.  
For this reason, we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  
That you might walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;  
Strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;  
Giving thanks unto the Father, who has made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;  
Who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son;  
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins;  
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature;  
For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him and for Him;  
And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.  
And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence.  
For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell;  
And, having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.  
And you, who were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled  
In the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His sight:  
If you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard and which was preached to every creature under heaven; of which I, Paul, am made a minister;  
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is lacking in the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His body's sake, which is the church;  
Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;  
Even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to His saints;  
To whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;  
Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;  
To this end, I also labor, striving according to His working, which works in me mightily.
