On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the children of Israel gathered together in fasting, wearing sackcloth and dust on their heads.
The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, standing and confessing their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
They stood in their place and read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day; for another quarter, they confessed and worshipped the LORD their God.
Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
The Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, "Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever; blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
You alone are the LORD; you made the heavens, the highest heavens, with all their host, the earth and everything in it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all; the host of heaven worships you.
You are the LORD God who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and gave him the name Abraham;
You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites to his descendants, and you have fulfilled your words; for you are righteous.
You saw the affliction of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry by the Red Sea;
You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his servants, and all the people of his land, for you knew they dealt proudly against them. Thus, you made a name for yourself, as it is this day.
You divided the sea before them, so they went through the midst of the sea on dry land; their pursuers you hurled into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
Moreover, you led them by a cloudy pillar during the day and by a pillar of fire at night, to give them light on the path they should take.
You came down on Mount Sinai, spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, true laws, good statutes, and commandments.
You made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws through your servant Moses.
You provided them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought forth water from the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they would go in to possess the land you had sworn to give them.
But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly, stiffened their necks, and did not listen to your commandments.
They refused to obey, were not mindful of your wonders that you performed among them; they hardened their necks and, in their rebellion, appointed a captain to return to their bondage. Yet you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; you did not forsake them.
Even when they made a molten calf and said, "This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt," and committed great provocations,
You, in your manifold mercies, did not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day to lead them on their way, nor the pillar of fire by night to give them light on the path they should take.
You also gave your good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and provided them water for their thirst.
For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, so they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
Moreover, you gave them kingdoms and nations, and divided them into districts; so they possessed the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
Their children you multiplied as the stars of heaven and brought them into the land you promised their fathers that they would go in to possess.
So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, along with their kings and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they wished.
They took strong cities and a fertile land, and possessed houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance; so they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.
Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you, casting your law behind their backs, and killed your prophets who testified against them to turn them back to you; they committed great provocations.
Therefore, you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried out to you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies, you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies.
But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore, you left them in the hand of their enemies, who had dominion over them. Yet when they returned and cried out to you, you heard them from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies.
You testified against them to bring them back to your law; yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, which if a man does, he shall live in them; they withdrew the shoulder, hardened their neck, and would not listen.
Yet for many years you bore with them and testified against them by your Spirit in your prophets; yet they would not listen; therefore, you gave them into the hands of the peoples of the lands.
Nevertheless, for your great mercies' sake, you did not utterly consume them or forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.
Now therefore, our God, the great, mighty, and terrible God, who keeps covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble that has come upon us, on our kings, princes, priests, prophets, fathers, and all your people, seem little before you, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day.
However, you are just in all that has come upon us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly.
Neither have our kings, princes, priests, nor our fathers kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and testimonies, with which you testified against them.
For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fertile land which you set before them; neither did they turn from their wicked works.
Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.
And it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins; they also have dominion over our bodies and our cattle at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
And because of all this, we make a sure covenant and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests seal it.
