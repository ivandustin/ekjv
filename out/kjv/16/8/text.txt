And all the people gathered together as one man in the street before the Water Gate; they spoke to Ezra the scribe, asking him to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, including men and women, and all who could understand, on the first day of the seventh month.
He read from the book in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men, women, and those who could understand; the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden pulpit made for this purpose; beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right, and on his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, "Amen, Amen," lifting their hands; they bowed their heads and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites helped the people understand the law, and the people stood in their place.
They read from the book of the law of God distinctly, gave the sense, and helped them understand the reading.
Nehemiah, who is the Tirshatha, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
Then he said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our LORD. Do not be sorrowful, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, "Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved."
And all the people went their way to eat, drink, send portions, and make great joy, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
On the second day, the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites gathered together to Ezra the scribe to understand the words of the law.
They found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
They were to proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the mountain and bring olive branches, pine branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees to make booths, as it is written."
So the people went out, brought them, and made booths for themselves, each on the roof of their house, in their courts, in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the Water Gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
All the congregation that had returned from captivity made booths and sat under them; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun until that day, the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.
Day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the book of the law of God. They kept the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day, there was a solemn assembly, according to the custom.
