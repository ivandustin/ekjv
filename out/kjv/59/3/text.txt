My brethren, do not become many teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.
For in many ways we stumble all. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to control the whole body.
Look, we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they may obey us; and we turn their entire body.
Consider also the ships, which, though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, are turned by a very small rudder, wherever the captain desires.
Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest a little fire ignites!
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire by hell.
For every kind of beast, bird, serpent, and creature of the sea is tamed and has been tamed by mankind;
but no one can tame the tongue; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
With it, we bless God, even the Father; and with it, we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God.
Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.
Does a fountain send forth at the same place both sweet water and bitter?
Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives? Or a vine, figs? So no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.
This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
