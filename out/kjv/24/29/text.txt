Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders who were taken captive, as well as to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon;  
(After Jeconiah the king, the queen, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the carpenters and smiths, had departed from Jerusalem;)  
By the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon) saying,  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who are taken captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;  
Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce;  
Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they may bear sons and daughters; increase in number there, and do not decrease.  
And seek the peace of the city to which I have caused you to be taken captive, and pray to the LORD for it: for in its peace you will find peace.  
For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to dream.  
For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, says the LORD.  
For thus says the LORD: After seventy years are completed in Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill my good promise to you, bringing you back to this place.  
For I know the plans I have for you, says the LORD, plans for peace and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.  
Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.  
I will be found by you, says the LORD; and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I have driven you, says the LORD; and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.  
Because you have said, "The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon;"  
Know that thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brothers who have not gone with you into captivity;  
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will bring upon them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like worthless figs that cannot be eaten because they are so bad.  
I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will deliver them to be scattered among all the kingdoms of the earth, becoming a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations to which I have driven them.  
Because they have not listened to my words, says the LORD, which I sent to them through my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not listen, says the LORD.  
Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes.  
And a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah in Babylon, saying, "The LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire."  
Because they have committed wickedness in Israel, have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lies in my name, which I did not command them; I know, and I am a witness, says the LORD.  
Thus you shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,  
Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  
"The LORD has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, so that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man who is mad and makes himself a prophet, you should put him in prison and in stocks."  
Now, why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you?  
For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, "This captivity is long: build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit."  
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  
Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie:  
Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for my people, says the LORD, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.
