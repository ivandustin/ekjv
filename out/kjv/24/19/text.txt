Thus says the LORD: Go and obtain a potter's earthen vessel, and gather the elders of the people and the elders of the priests.
Proceed to the valley of the son of Hinnom, near the entrance of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I will instruct you.
And say, "Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place, and whoever hears of it, his ears will tingle."
For they have forsaken me, estranged this place, and burned incense to other gods, whom neither they nor their ancestors have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
They have also built high places for Baal, to burn their sons in fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command, nor did I speak, nor did it ever enter my mind.
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when this place shall no longer be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter.
I will nullify the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives; their corpses will be given as food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
I will make this city desolate and a hissing; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; they shall each eat the flesh of their friend during the siege and distress, when their enemies and those who seek their lives press in on them.
Then you shall break the vessel in the sight of the men who accompany you,
And say to them, "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again; they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no more room to bury."
Thus will I do to this place, says the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Tophet.
The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out drink offerings to other gods.
Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people,
"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city and all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks so as not to hear my words."
