Your own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will reprove you: therefore, know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.
For a long time, I have broken your yoke and burst your bonds; yet you said, "I will not transgress," while wandering on every high hill and under every green tree, playing the harlot.
Yet I had planted you as a noble vine, entirely a right seed: how then have you turned into a degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?
For even if you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, your iniquity is still marked before me, says the Lord GOD.
How can you say, "I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim"? Consider your ways in the valley, and know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her paths;
A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, snuffing the wind at her pleasure; in her season, who can turn her away? All who seek her will not tire themselves; in her month, they will find her.
Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, "There is no hope; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go."
As a thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets.
Saying to a piece of wood, "You are my father," and to a stone, "You have brought me forth": for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble, they will say, "Arise, and save us."

Why do you trim your path to seek love? Therefore, you have also taught the wicked your ways.
Also, in your skirts is found the blood of the innocent poor: I have not discovered it through secret means, but openly among all these.
Yet you say, "Because I am innocent, surely his anger will turn away from me." Behold, I will contend with you, because you claim, "I have not sinned."
Why do you wander so much to change your ways? You will also be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
Yes, you shall depart from him, with your hands upon your head; for the LORD has rejected your trust, and you will not succeed in it.
