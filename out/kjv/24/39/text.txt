In the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was breached.
All the princes of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the middle gate, including Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, along with the remaining princes of the king of Babylon.
When Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saw them, along with all the men of war, he fled and left the city by night, taking the route through the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls, and he escaped to the plain.
However, the Chaldean army pursued him and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. After capturing him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him.
Then the king of Babylon executed Zedekiah's sons in Riblah before his eyes, and he also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Furthermore, he blinded Zedekiah, bound him in chains, and took him to Babylon.
The Chaldeans set fire to the king's palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away the remaining people who were left in the city, along with those who had defected to him, and the rest of the populace that remained.
However, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left behind the poor of the people who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and he provided them with vineyards and fields at that time.
Now Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, instructed Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
"Take him, and pay close attention to him; do him no harm, but treat him as he requests."
So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent for Jeremiah, along with Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the princes of the king of Babylon;
They took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, so that he could take him home; thus, he dwelt among the people.
Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the prison, saying,
"Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be fulfilled in that day before you.'
But I will deliver you on that day, says the LORD, and you shall not be handed over to the men of whom you are afraid.
For I will surely rescue you, and you shall not fall by the sword; your life shall be a prize for you, because you have put your trust in me, says the LORD."
