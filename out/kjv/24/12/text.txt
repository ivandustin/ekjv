Righteous are You, O LORD, when I bring my case before You; yet allow me to discuss Your judgments with You: Why do the wicked prosper? Why are all those who act deceitfully so happy?
You have planted them; indeed, they have taken root. They grow and bear fruit; you are close to their words, but far from their hearts.
But You, O LORD, know me: You have seen me and tested my heart toward You; pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of sacrifice.
How long will the land mourn, and the plants of every field wither, due to the wickedness of those who inhabit it? The animals are perishing, and the birds as well; for they have declared, "He will not witness our final fate."
If you have run with footmen and they have tired you, how can you compete with horses? And if in the land of peace, where you placed your trust, they have wearied you, how will you manage in the tumult of the Jordan?
For even your brothers, and the household of your father, have acted deceitfully towards you; indeed, they have summoned a crowd against you: do not trust them, even if they speak kind words to you.
I have abandoned my home; I have relinquished my heritage. I have entrusted the beloved of my heart into the hands of her adversaries.
My heritage feels to me like a lion in the forest; it roars against me, and for that reason, I have come to despise it.
My heritage is to me like a speckled bird; the birds around her are hostile. Come, gather all the beasts of the field, come to consume.
Many pastors have ravaged my vineyard; they have trampled my share underfoot, turning my delightful portion into a barren wasteland.
They have rendered it desolate, and in its desolation, it mourns for me; the entire land has become desolate, as no one takes it to heart.
The spoilers have come upon all high places throughout the wilderness; for the sword of the LORD shall consume from one end of the land to the other end of the land: no flesh shall find peace.
They have planted wheat, yet will harvest thorns; they have exerted effort, but will not gain; and they will be embarrassed by their earnings due to the intense wrath of the LORD.
Thus says the LORD concerning all my wicked neighbors who encroach upon the inheritance I have given to my people Israel: Behold, I will uproot them from their land and remove the house of Judah from their midst.
And it will happen that after I have gathered them, I will return and show compassion to them, bringing each person back to their heritage and to their land.
And it will happen that if they earnestly study the ways of my people, and swear by my name, "The LORD lives," just as they instructed my people to swear by Baal, then they will be established among my people.
However, if they refuse to obey, I will completely uproot and annihilate that nation, says the LORD.
