And all the congregation raised their voices and cried out; the people wept that night.
The children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!"
"Why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, so that our wives and children become prey? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?"
They said to one another, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt."
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the entire assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who explored the land, tore their clothes.
They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land we explored is exceedingly good."
"If the LORD is pleased with us, He will bring us into this land and give it to usâ€”a land flowing with milk and honey."
"Only do not rebel against the LORD, and do not fear the people of the land; they are our bread. Their protection has departed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."
But the entire congregation threatened to stone them with stones. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle before all the children of Israel.
The LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people provoke Me? How long will it be before they believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them?"
"I will strike them with a plague and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."
Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear it, for You brought up this people by Your might from among them."
"They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land; they have heard that You, LORD, are among this people, that You, LORD, are seen face to face, and that Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
"Now if You kill all this people as one man, then the nations that have heard of Your fame will say,"
"'Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slain them in the wilderness.'"
"And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, as You have spoken, saying,"
"The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation."
"Pardon, I beseech You, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people from Egypt until now."
The LORD said, "I have pardoned according to your word;
But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD."
"Because all those men who have seen My glory and My miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tested Me these ten times and have not heeded My voice,"
"Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who provoked Me see it."
"But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring him into the land where he went, and his descendants shall possess it."
(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) "Tomorrow, turn and head into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that murmurs against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against Me."
"Say to them, 'As truly as I live,' says the LORD, 'as you have spoken in My hearing, so will I do to you:
Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all who were numbered among you, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me.'"
"Surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
"But your little ones, whom you said would be a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised."
"But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness."
"And your children shall wander in the wilderness for forty years and bear your iniquities, until your carcasses are wasted in the wilderness."
"According to the number of the days you explored the land, forty days, for each day a year, you shall bear your iniquities for forty years, and you shall know My breach of promise."
"I, the LORD, have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation that is gathered against Me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
"And the men whom Moses sent to explore the land, who returned and made all the congregation murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land,"
"Even those men who brought up the evil report about the land died by the plague before the LORD."
"But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among the men who went to explore the land, lived."
Moses told these things to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
They rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "Here we are, and we will go up to the place the LORD has promised, for we have sinned."
Moses said, "Why do you now transgress the commandment of the LORD? It will not succeed."
"Do not go up, for the LORD is not among you; you will be defeated before your enemies."
"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned away from the LORD, the LORD will not be with you."
But they presumed to go up to the hilltop; nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of the LORD and Moses did not depart from the camp.
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who dwelt in that hill attacked them and defeated them, even to Hormah.
