And it came to pass that, while he was praying in a certain place, when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
He replied to them, "When you pray, say: Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us each day our daily bread."
"And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
He then said to them, "Which of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight, saying, 'Friend, lend me three loaves;
for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him'?
And he from within will answer and say, 'Do not trouble me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you anything.'
I tell you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will rise and give him as much as he needs."
"And I say to you, Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
"For everyone who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened."
"If a son asks for bread from any of you who is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?
Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute spoke, and the people marveled.
But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the chief of the demons."
And others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.
But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls."
"If Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub."
"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges."
"But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you."
"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace.
But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoils."
"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters."
"When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first."
And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you."
But he replied, "Indeed, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it."
As the crowd gathered closely, he began to say, "This is a wicked generation: they seek a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be a sign to this generation.
The queen of the south will rise in judgment against the men of this generation and condemn them, for she traveled from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment against this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
No one, after lighting a candle, puts it in a hidden place or under a bushel, but on a candlestick, so that those who enter may see the light.
The eye is the lamp of the body; therefore, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is unhealthy, your body will be full of darkness.
Take care, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
If your whole body is full of light, with no part dark, it will be entirely illuminated, as when a bright candle gives you light.
As he spoke, a certain Pharisee invited him to dine with him; he went in and reclined at the table.
When the Pharisee saw this, he was surprised that he did not first wash before the meal.
The Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
You foolish ones! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
But give as alms those things that are within; and behold, everything will be clean for you.
But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint, rue, and all kinds of herbs, yet neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without realizing it.
One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us too."
He replied, "Woe to you, lawyers! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your ancestors killed them.
So you testify that you approve of the deeds of your ancestors; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
Therefore, the wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecute.'
So that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, will be charged against this generation;
From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Truly, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.
Woe to you, lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering."
As he said these things, the scribes and Pharisees began to press him hard and provoke him to speak about many things,
Laying in wait for him, seeking to catch something from his mouth that they might accuse him.
