After these events, the LORD appointed seventy others and sent them out two by two ahead of him into every city and place where he intended to go.
He then said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the workers are few. Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest."
"Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves."
"Do not carry a purse, a bag, or sandals; and greet no one along the way."
"When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'"
"If a person of peace is there, your peace will rest upon them; if not, it will return to you."
"Stay in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the worker deserves their wages. Do not move from house to house."
"When you enter a city and they welcome you, eat what is set before you."
"Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'"
"But if you enter a city and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,"
"'Even the dust of your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless, know this: the kingdom of God has come near.'"
"I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that city."
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
"But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you."
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades."
"Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me."
The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."
He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."
"Behold, I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions, and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you."
"However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
At that time, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do."
"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see."
"For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it."
Just then, a lawyer stood up to test him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
He asked him, "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"
The lawyer answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."
Jesus replied, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."
But he, wanting to justify himself, asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead."
Now by chance, a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.
He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
The next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, "Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back."
"Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"
He said, "The one who showed him mercy." Jesus said to him, "You go, and do likewise."
As they went on their way, Jesus entered a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.
But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she went up to him and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me."
But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things."
"But one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her."
