In the third month, when the children of Israel had departed from the land of Egypt, they arrived in the wilderness of Sinai on the same day.
They had left Rephidim and reached the desert of Sinai, where they set up camp in the wilderness; thus, Israel camped in front of the mountain.
Moses ascended to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel:
You have witnessed what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
Now, therefore, if you will truly obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be a treasured possession to me above all peoples, for all the earth is mine.
And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you shall speak to the children of Israel."
Moses came and summoned the elders of the people, presenting all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
All the people responded together, saying, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." And Moses relayed the words of the people to the LORD.
The LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and believe you forever." Moses conveyed the people's words to the LORD.
The LORD instructed Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.
And be ready for the third day, for on that day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.
You shall set boundaries for the people all around, saying, 'Take care not to go up the mountain or touch its edge; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
No hand shall touch it; instead, he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; whether beast or man, it shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they may come up to the mountain."
Moses descended from the mountain to the people and consecrated them; they washed their clothes.
He said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not approach your wives."
On the morning of the third day, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud covered the mountain, with the sound of a trumpet exceedingly loud, causing all the people in the camp to tremble.
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; the smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
As the trumpet sounded long and grew louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice.
The LORD descended upon Mount Sinai, at the top of the mountain, and called Moses up to the summit; Moses went up.
The LORD instructed Moses, "Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
Also, let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them."
Moses replied to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you commanded us, saying, 'Set boundaries around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
The LORD said to him, "Go down, and you shall come up, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them."
So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
