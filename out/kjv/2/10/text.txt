And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, so that I may display my signs before him.
And you shall tell your son and your grandson about the things I have done in Egypt and my signs that I performed among them, so that you may know that I am the LORD."
Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh and said, "Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may serve me."
If you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
They will cover the surface of the land, making it impossible to see the ground; they will consume what little remains after the hail and will eat every tree that grows in your fields.
They will fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptiansâ€”something that neither your ancestors nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they were on the earth until now." And he turned and left Pharaoh.
Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go so that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is destroyed?"
Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God. But who exactly will go?"
Moses replied, "We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds; for we must hold a feast to the LORD."
Pharaoh said to them, "The LORD be with you if I let you go, along with your little ones. Look, you have some evil intentions.
Not so! Go now, you who are men, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desired." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
The LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left."
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD sent an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; when morning came, the east wind brought the locusts.
The locusts ascended over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the regions of Egypt; they were very grievous, and there had never been locusts like them before, nor will there ever be again.
They covered the entire surface of the earth, so that the land was darkened; they consumed every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, leaving no green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
Now, therefore, forgive my sin, I pray, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God to take away this death from me."
He went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
The LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the coasts of Egypt.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the children of Israel go.
The LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt."
Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
Pharaoh called to Moses and said, "Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and herds remain behind. Let your little ones also go with you."
Moses said, "You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
Our livestock will go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we must take some of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there."
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Take heed to yourself; see my face no more, for on the day you see my face, you shall die."
Moses replied, "You have spoken well; I will see your face again no more."
