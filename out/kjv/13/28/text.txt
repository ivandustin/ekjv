And David gathered all the leaders of Israel, including the tribal leaders, the captains of the divisions that served the king in rotation, the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, the stewards of all the king's possessions and those of his sons, along with the officers, the mighty warriors, and all the valiant men, to Jerusalem.
Then King David stood up and addressed his brethren and his people: "Listen to me, my brothers and my people: I had it in my heart to build a resting place for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God, and I had made preparations for the construction.
But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name, for you have been a man of war and have shed blood.'
Nevertheless, the LORD God of Israel chose me from all my father's house to be king over Israel forever; for He has chosen Judah to be the ruler, and from the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among my father's sons, He chose me to be king over all Israel.
Of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many), He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
He said to me, 'Your son Solomon shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.'
Moreover, I will establish his kingdom forever, if he remains steadfast in keeping my commandments and my judgments, as he does today.
Now, therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the LORD, and in the presence of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your children forever.
And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him with a perfect heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it.
Then David provided Solomon, his son, with the blueprint for the porch, the houses, the treasuries, the upper chambers, the inner rooms, and the place of the mercy seat,
as well as the design of everything he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, and for all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for the dedicated gifts.
He also provided for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels used in the service of the house of the LORD.
He gave gold by weight for the items made of gold, for all instruments of every kind of service; silver also by weight for all instruments of silver used in service.
He specified the weight for the gold candlesticks and their lamps, by weight for each candlestick and its lamps; and for the silver candlesticks by weight, both for the candlestick and for its lamps, according to the use of each candlestick.
He also provided gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for each table, and likewise silver for the tables of silver.
He provided pure gold for the fleshhooks, the bowls, and the cups; and for the golden basins, he gave gold by weight for each basin, and likewise silver by weight for each silver basin.
He provided refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and gold for the design of the chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
David said, "All this the LORD made me understand in writing by His hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern."
And David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do it; do not be afraid or dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; He will not fail you or forsake you until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
And behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites will be with you for all the service of the house of God; and every skilled man who is willing to work will be at your command, along with the princes and all the people who will be entirely at your disposal."
