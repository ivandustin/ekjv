All of Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."
Furthermore, in the past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel in and out; and the LORD your God said to you, "You shall shepherd my people Israel, and you shall be ruler over my people Israel."
Thus, all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had spoken through Samuel.
David and all Israel then went to Jerusalem, which is also known as Jebus, where the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, resided.
The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not come here." Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.
David declared, "Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain." So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and became chief.
David settled in the stronghold, and therefore it was called the city of David.
He built the city around it, from Millo and beyond, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
Thus, David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.
These are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, as the LORD had spoken concerning Israel.
This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains; he raised his spear against three hundred men and killed them at one time.
Next was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.
He was with David at Pasdammim, where the Philistines gathered for battle, and there was a plot of ground full of barley; the people fled from the Philistines.
They took their stand in the middle of that plot, defended it, and struck down the Philistines; and the LORD granted them a great victory.
Three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, at the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine army was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
David was then in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
David longed and said, "Oh, that someone would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
The three broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and brought it back to David; but David would not drink it, instead, he poured it out to the LORD.
He said, "My God forbid that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives? For they brought it at the risk of their lives." Therefore, he would not drink it. These are the deeds of the three mighty men.
Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the three; he raised his spear against three hundred men and killed them, earning a name among the three.
Among the three, he was more honorable than the other two, for he was their captain; however, he did not attain to the first three.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a valiant man from Kabzeel, performed many great deeds; he killed two lion-like men of Moab and went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
He also killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall; the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, took the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
These are the deeds of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he earned a name among the three mighty men.
He was honored among the thirty, but did not attain to the first three; David appointed him over his guard.
The valiant men of the armies included Asahel, the brother of Joab, and Elhanan, the son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
