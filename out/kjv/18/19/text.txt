Then Job responded and said,
How long will you torment my soul and shatter me with your words?
These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed to make yourselves strange to me.
And if it is true that I have erred, my error remains with me.
If you will indeed exalt yourselves against me and plead my reproach against me:
Know now that God has overthrown me and has surrounded me with His net.
Behold, I cry out for justice, but I am not heard; I call out loudly, but there is no judgment.
He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness in my paths.
He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head.
He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone; my hope has been removed like a tree.
He has also kindled His wrath against me and counts me as one of His enemies.
His troops gather together, raise their way against me, and encamp around my dwelling.
He has put my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are truly estranged from me.
My relatives have failed me, and my close friends have forgotten me.
Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.
I called my servant, but he did not answer; I pleaded with him with my mouth.
My breath is strange to my wife, though I plead for the sake of the children of my own body.
Yes, young children despise me; I rise, and they speak against me.
All my intimate friends abhor me, and those I loved have turned against me.
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.
Why do you persecute me as God does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
Oh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!
That they were engraved with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever!
For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
And though worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my heart is consumed within me.
But you should say, Why do we persecute him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
Be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.
