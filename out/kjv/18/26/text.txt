But Job responded and said,
How have you helped the one who is powerless? How do you save the arm that lacks strength?
How have you advised the one who lacks wisdom? And how have you thoroughly explained things as they truly are?
To whom have you spoken words? And whose spirit came from you?
The dead are formed from beneath the waters, along with their inhabitants.
The realm of the dead is exposed before Him, and destruction has no veil.
He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing.
He binds the waters in His thick clouds; yet the clouds do not burst under them.
He restrains the face of His throne and spreads His cloud over it.
He has set boundaries for the waters until day and night come to an end.
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke.
He divides the sea with His power, and by His understanding, He strikes down the proud.
By His spirit, He has adorned the heavens; His hand has formed the twisting serpent.
Behold, these are just parts of His ways: but how small a fraction is known of Him? And who can comprehend the thunder of His power?
