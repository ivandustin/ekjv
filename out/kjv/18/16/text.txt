Then Job responded and said,
"I have heard many such things: you are all miserable comforters.
Will vain words ever cease? What gives you the courage to respond?
I could also speak as you do; if your situation were mine, I could heap words against you and shake my head in disdain.
But I would strengthen you with my words, and the movement of my lips would ease your sorrow.
Though I speak, my grief remains unrelieved; and if I hold back, what comfort do I find?
But now He has made me weary; you have made all my companions desolate.
You have filled me with wrinkles, which serve as a witness against me; my leanness rising within me bears witness to my face.
He tears me apart in His wrath, who hates me; He gnashes His teeth at me; my enemy sharpens his gaze upon me.
They gape at me with their mouths; they strike me on the cheek in contempt; they gather together against me.
God has delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over to the hands of the wicked.
I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He has taken me by the neck, shaken me to pieces, and set me up as a target.
His archers surround me; He splits my kidneys apart and does not spare; He pours out my bile on the ground.
He breaks me with breach upon breach; He charges at me like a giant.
I have sewn sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust.
My face is stained with weeping, and the shadow of death hangs over my eyelids;
Not for any injustice in my hands; my prayer is pure.
O earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry find no resting place.
Now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
My friends scorn me, but my eyes pour out tears to God.
O that someone might plead with God for a man, as one pleads for his neighbor!
When a few years have passed, I shall go the way from which I shall not return."
