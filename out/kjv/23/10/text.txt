Woe to those who enact unjust laws and write oppressive decrees;
To divert the needy from justice and deny the rights of the poor among my people, so that widows become their prey and they rob the fatherless!
And what will you do on the day of reckoning, and in the devastation that will come from afar? To whom will you turn for help? Where will you leave your glory?
Without me, they will bow down among the captives and fall among the slain. Yet, despite all this, his anger is not turned away, and his hand is still stretched out.
O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.
I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and I will give him a charge against the people of my wrath, to plunder and take the spoil, and to trample them down like the mire of the streets.
However, he does not intend this, nor does his heart think so; rather, it is in his heart to destroy and cut off many nations.
For he says, "Are not my princes all kings?"
Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
As my hand has found the kingdoms of idols, and their graven images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, do the same to Jerusalem and her idols?
Therefore, it will come to pass that when the Lord has completed his work on Mount Zion and Jerusalem, I will punish the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his lofty looks.
For he says, "By the strength of my hand I have accomplished this, and by my wisdom; for I am clever: I have removed the boundaries of the people, plundered their treasures, and brought down the inhabitants like a mighty warrior."
And my hand has found the riches of the people like a nest; as one gathers abandoned eggs, I have gathered all the earth, and there was none that flapped a wing, or opened a mouth, or chirped.
Shall the axe boast against the one who wields it? Or shall the saw exalt itself against the one who uses it? As if the rod should shake itself against those who lift it, or as if the staff should lift itself, as if it were not wood.
Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory, he will kindle a fire like the burning of a flame.
And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: it will burn and consume his thorns and briers in a single day;
And it will consume the glory of his forest and his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they will be as when a standard-bearer faints.
And the remaining trees of his forest will be few, so that a child may write them down.
And it will come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them; but they will trust in the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
The remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them will return: the decree of destruction will overflow with righteousness.
For the Lord GOD of hosts will carry out a decree, determined in the midst of all the land.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people dwelling in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian: he will strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, as in the manner of Egypt.
For yet a little while, and the indignation will cease, and my anger will be directed at their destruction.
And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge against him, like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so will he lift it up in the manner of Egypt.
And it will come to pass in that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing.
He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash, he has laid up his supplies:
They have crossed over the passage; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul has fled.
Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: let it be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.
Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather to flee.
Yet he will remain at Nob that day: he will shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will cut down the bough with terror: and the tall ones will be hewn down, and the proud will be humbled.
And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by a mighty one.
