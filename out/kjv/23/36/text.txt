In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, advanced against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
The king of Assyria dispatched Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a formidable army. He positioned himself by the conduit of the upper pool along the highway of the fuller's field.
Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, along with Shebna the scribe and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, approached him.
Rabshakeh addressed them, saying, "Tell Hezekiah this: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What is this confidence that you have?
I say, what do you say? (These are merely empty words.) I have counsel and strength for war. On whom do you rely that you rebel against me?
Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt; if a man leans on it, it will pierce his hand: so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.
But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'?
Now, therefore, make a pledge to my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to provide riders for them.
How then can you expect to turn away the face of even one captain of the least of my master's servants, while you put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
And am I now here without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'
Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in the Aramaic language; we understand it. Do not speak to us in the Hebrew language, in the hearing of the people on the wall."
But Rabshakeh replied, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men sitting on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, saying, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
Thus says the king: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: Make an agreement with me and come out to me; and eat each of you from your own vine and fig tree, and drink each of you the waters of your own cistern,
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
Which of all the gods of these lands has delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
But they remained silent and did not answer him a word, for the king had commanded them, saying, "Do not answer him."
Then Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe and Joah, son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
