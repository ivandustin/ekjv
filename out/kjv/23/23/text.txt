The burden of Tyre. Howl, O ships of Tarshish; for it has been laid waste, leaving no house and no entry: from the land of Chittim, it has been revealed to them.
Be still, O inhabitants of the isle; you whom the merchants of Zidon, who traverse the sea, have enriched.
And by great waters, the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; she is a marketplace for nations.
Be ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I do not travail, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish young men, nor raise up virgins.
As the report concerning Egypt comes, so shall they be greatly pained at the news of Tyre.
Cross over to Tarshish; howl, O inhabitants of the isle.
Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is from ancient days? Her own feet shall carry her far off to sojourn.
Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?
The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
Pass through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.
He stretched out His hand over the sea, He shook the kingdoms: the LORD has given a command against the merchant city, to destroy its strongholds.
And He said, You shall no longer rejoice, O oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, cross over to Chittim; there too you shall find no rest.
Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, until the Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness: they set up its towers, they raised its palaces; and He brought it to ruin.
Howl, O ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten for seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years, Tyre shall sing like a harlot.
Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten harlot; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.
And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for those who dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
