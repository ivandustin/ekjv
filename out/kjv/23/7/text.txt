In the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, it happened that Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, marched against Jerusalem to wage war, but they could not succeed.
The house of David was informed, saying, "Syria has allied with Ephraim." This news troubled Ahaz and his people, as the trees of the forest tremble in the wind.
Then the LORD spoke to Isaiah, saying, "Go now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shearjashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the fuller's field.
Tell him, 'Take heed and remain calm; do not fear, nor let your heart be faint because of the two smoldering firebrandsâ€”the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and the son of Remaliah.'
For Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying,
'Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and let us set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal.'
Thus says the Lord GOD: 'It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.'
For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered so that it will no longer be a people.
The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you do not believe, you will not be established.'
Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
'Ask for a sign from the LORD your God; ask it either in the depths or in the heights above.'
But Ahaz replied, 'I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD.'
Then he said, 'Hear now, O house of David; is it a trivial thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?
Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
He will eat butter and honey, so that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.
For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you dread will be forsaken by both of its kings.
The LORD will bring upon you, your people, and your father's house days that have not come since the day Ephraim departed from Judah, even the king of Assyria.
And it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
They will come and rest in the desolate valleys, in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns and bushes.
In that day, the Lord will shave with a hired razor, namely, with those beyond the river, with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; it will also consume the beard.
It shall come to pass in that day that a man will rear a young cow and two sheep;
And it shall come to pass that, because of the abundance of milk they give, he will eat butter; for butter and honey will everyone eat who is left in the land.
In that day, every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels will become briers and thorns.
Men will come there with bows and arrows, for all the land will become briers and thorns.
And on all the hills that are dug with a mattock, there will be no fear of briers and thorns; it will be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle.
