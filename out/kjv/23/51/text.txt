Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: consider the rock from which you were cut, and the quarry from which you were dug.
Look to Abraham your ancestor, and to Sarah who bore you; for I called him alone, blessed him, and increased him.
For the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her desolate places; He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness will be found there, along with thanksgiving and the sound of music.
Listen to me, my people; and pay attention, O my nation: for a law will go forth from me, and I will establish my judgment as a light for the people.
My righteousness is near; my salvation has gone forth, and my arms will judge the people; the coastlands will wait for me, and on my arm they will place their trust.
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth below: for the heavens will disappear like smoke, and the earth will wear out like a garment, and those who dwell therein will die in like manner; but my salvation will last forever, and my righteousness will not be abolished.
Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; do not fear the reproach of men, nor be afraid of their insults.
For the moth will consume them like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will last forever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awaken as in the days of old, in the generations of the past. Are you not the one who cut Rahab and wounded the dragon?
Are you not the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made a path through the depths of the sea for the ransomed to cross over?
Therefore, the redeemed of the LORD will return and come with singing to Zion; everlasting joy will crown their heads; they will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning will flee away.
I, even I, am the one who comforts you: who are you that you should be afraid of a mere mortal, a human being who is like grass?
And you forget the LORD your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth; and you have feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? Where is the fury of the oppressor?
The captive exile hastens to be released, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
But I am the LORD your God, who divided the sea, whose waves roared; the LORD of hosts is His name.
And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, so that I may plant the heavens, lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, "You are my people."
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, who has drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of His fury; you have drunk the dregs of the cup of trembling and drained it.
There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne; nor is there anyone who takes her by the hand among all the sons she has raised.
These two things have come upon you; who will mourn for you? Desolation and destruction, famine and sword: by whom shall I comfort you?
Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets, like a wild bull in a net; they are filled with the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted one, drunk but not with wine:
Thus says your Lord, the LORD, and your God who pleads the cause of His people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you will never drink it again.
But I will put it into the hands of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, "Bow down, that we may cross over"; and you have laid your body like the ground, and like the street, to those who went over.
