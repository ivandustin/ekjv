In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
The same was in the beginning with God.  
All things were made by Him; and without Him, nothing was made that was made.  
In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.  
And the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.  
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  
He came as a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.  
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.  
That was the true Light, which enlightens every man that comes into the world.  
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, yet the world did not know Him.  
He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.  
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the power to become the sons of God, even to those who believe in His name:  
Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  
John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I spoke, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.'"  
And of His fullness, we have all received, and grace upon grace.  
For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  
No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.  
And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"  
And he confessed, and did not deny; but confessed, "I am not the Christ."  
And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he said, "I am not." "Are you that prophet?" And he answered, "No."  
Then they said to him, "Who are you? That we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"  
He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as said the prophet Isaiah."  
And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.  
And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that prophet?"
John responded to them, saying, "I baptize with water; but there stands one among you whom you do not know.  
He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.  
These events took place in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.  
The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!  
This is the one of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'  
And I did not know him; but in order that he might be revealed to Israel, I came baptizing with water.  
John bore witness, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.  
And I did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'  
And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.  
The next day, John stood again, and two of his disciples were with him;  
And looking at Jesus as he walked by, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"  
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  
Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, "What do you seek?" They said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"  
He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.  
One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.  
He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ).  
And he brought him to Jesus. When Jesus looked at him, he said, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter).  
The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee, and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."  
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."  
Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."  
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"  
Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."  
Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel."  
Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."
And he said to him, Truly, truly, I tell you, from now on you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.
