What advantage does the Jew have? Or what benefit is there in circumcision?
In many ways: primarily, because the oracles of God were entrusted to them.
But what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?
Absolutely not: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, so that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged.
However, if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what should we say? Is God unjust for inflicting wrath? (I speak as a human)
Absolutely not: for how could God judge the world?
If the truth of God has increased through my falsehood to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
And not rather, as we are slanderously reported, and as some claim we say, "Let us do evil so that good may come"? Their condemnation is just.
What then? Are we any better? No, not at all: for we have already established that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin;
As it is written, "There is no one righteous, not even one."
There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
All have turned away; they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.
Their throats are open graves; they deceive with their tongues; the venom of vipers is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and misery mark their paths.
And they do not know the way of peace.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in His sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law, we become conscious of sin.
But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
And all are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of His blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
He did it to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.
For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
Since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
Do we then nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
