Do any of you, having a dispute with another, go to court before the unjust, rather than before the saints?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge even the smallest matters?
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, matters that pertain to this life?
If you have disputes regarding this life, appoint those who are least esteemed in the church to judge.
I say this to your shame. Is it true that there is not a wise person among you? Not even one who can judge between his brothers?
But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.
Therefore, there is a serious fault among you, because you go to court with one another. Why not rather accept wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated?
No, you do wrong and cheat, and you do this to your brothers.
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who engage in homosexual acts,
Nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
And such were some of you; but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will destroy both it and them. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by His own power.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh."
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,
For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
