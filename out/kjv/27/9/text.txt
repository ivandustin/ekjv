In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the lineage of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood through books the number of years that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, indicating that He would fulfill seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
So I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek Him through prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
I prayed to the LORD my God, making my confession, and said, "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps the covenant and mercy for those who love Him and keep His commandments;
We have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly, and rebelled, turning away from Your precepts and judgments.
We have not listened to Your servants, the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
O LORD, righteousness belongs to You, but to us, confusion of face, as it is this day; to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where You have driven them, because of their trespass against You.
O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You.
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, even though we have rebelled against Him;
We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us through His servants, the prophets.
Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law, turning away so as not to obey Your voice; therefore, the curse has been poured upon us, and the oath written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.
He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven, nothing has been done as has been done to Jerusalem.
As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we did not make our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth.
Therefore, the LORD has watched over the evil and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all His works which He does, for we have not obeyed His voice.
And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and gained renown, as it is this day; we have sinned, we have acted wickedly.
O LORD, according to all Your righteousness, I beseech You, let Your anger and fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary, for the Lord's sake.
O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You for our righteousness, but for Your great mercies.
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and act; do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.
While I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Yes, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me swiftly, touching me about the time of the evening sacrifice.
He informed me, spoke with me, and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill and understanding.
At the beginning of your supplications, the command went out, and I have come to show you; for you are greatly beloved. Therefore, understand the matter and consider the vision.
Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.
Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times.
And after the sixty-two weeks, the Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; the end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war, desolations are determined.
And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week, he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate."
