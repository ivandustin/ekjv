And there was a man of Belial named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; he blew a trumpet and proclaimed, "We have no part in David, nor any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel!"
So every man of Israel departed from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri, while the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
When David arrived at his house in Jerusalem, he took the ten women, his concubines, whom he had left to care for the house, and placed them under guard. He provided for them but did not go in to them, so they remained confined until the day of their death, living as widows.
Then the king said to Amasa, "Gather the men of Judah for me within three days, and be here present."
Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah, but he delayed longer than the time David had set for him.
David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he find fortified cities and escape us."
Joab's men, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
When they reached the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. Joab was dressed in his battle garment, with a sword fastened to his side in its sheath; as he walked, it fell out.
Joab asked Amasa, "Are you well, my brother?" and took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
But Amasa did not notice the sword in Joab's hand, and Joab struck him in the fifth rib, spilling his entrails on the ground. He did not strike him again, and Amasa died. Joab and his brother Abishai then pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
One of Joab's men stood by him and said, "Whoever is for Joab and for David, let him follow Joab."
Amasa lay in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa off the highway into the field and covered him with a cloth, noticing that everyone who passed by stood still.
Once Amasa was removed from the highway, all the people continued after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
Joab went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites, and they gathered together to pursue him.
They besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, building a mound against the city, which stood in the trench, while all the people with Joab battered the wall to bring it down.
Then a wise woman cried out from the city, "Listen, listen! Please say to Joab, 'Come here so I can speak with you.'"
When he approached her, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" He replied, "I am." She then said, "Listen to the words of your servant." He answered, "I am listening."
She continued, "In the past, they used to say, 'Seek counsel at Abel,' and that settled the matter.
I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel; you seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?"
Joab replied, "Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy.
That is not the case; a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted his hand against the king, against David. Hand him over, and I will depart from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you over the wall."
The woman went to all the people in her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. He blew a trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, each man returning to his tent. Joab then returned to Jerusalem to the king.
Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites.
Adoram was in charge of the tribute, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder.
Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
Ira the Jairite was also a chief ruler under David.
