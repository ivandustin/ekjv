There was a famine during the reign of David that lasted three years, year after year; David sought guidance from the LORD. The LORD responded, saying it was due to Saul and his violent household, as he had killed the Gibeonites.
The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them; (the Gibeonites were not part of the children of Israel, but were remnants of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn an oath to them, yet Saul had attempted to kill them out of zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.)
David asked the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you? How can I make atonement so that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
The Gibeonites replied, "We do not want silver or gold from Saul or his household; nor should you kill any man in Israel for us." David responded, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
They answered the king, "The man who consumed us and plotted against us to eliminate us from the land of Israel,
Let seven of his sons be handed over to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD chose." The king agreed, saying, "I will give them to you."
However, the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath the LORD had made between David and Jonathan.
The king took the two sons of Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, named Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal, the daughter of Saul, whom she raised for Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who hanged them on a hill before the LORD. All seven were executed together during the harvest season, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it on a rock, from the start of the harvest until rain fell upon them from heaven. She did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
David was informed of what Rizpah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
David went and retrieved the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the men of Jabeshgilead, who had taken them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them after killing Saul at Gilboa.
He brought the bones of Saul and Jonathan from there and gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.
They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in the land of Benjamin, in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, his father. They fulfilled all that the king commanded, and afterward, God was appeased for the land.
Furthermore, the Philistines waged war against Israel again; David and his servants went down to fight the Philistines, and David grew weary.
Ishbibenob, one of the descendants of the giant, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze and who was armed with a new sword, intended to kill David.
But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to David's aid, struck down the Philistine, and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, "You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you extinguish the light of Israel."
After this, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob, where Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of the giant.
There was yet another battle in Gob against the Philistines, where Elhanan, the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
Another battle took place in Gath, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, totaling twenty-four; he was also a descendant of the giant.
When he defied Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.
These four were born to the giant in Gath and fell by the hand of David and his servants.
