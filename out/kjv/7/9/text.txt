And Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to speak with his mother's relatives and the entire family of his maternal grandfather, saying,
"Please speak to all the men of Shechem and ask them: Which is better for you, that all seventy sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you? Remember, I am your own flesh and blood."
His mother's relatives conveyed all these words to the men of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired reckless and worthless men to follow him.
He went to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone; however, Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, escaped because he hid himself.
All the men of Shechem gathered together, along with the house of Millo, and they made Abimelech king at the oak of the pillar in Shechem.
When Jotham heard this, he stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and cried out, "Listen to me, men of Shechem, that God may listen to you."
Once, the trees went out to anoint a king over themselves, and they said to the olive tree, "Reign over us."
But the olive tree replied, "Should I give up my abundance, which honors both God and man, to be promoted over the trees?"
Then the trees said to the fig tree, "Come, reign over us."
But the fig tree answered, "Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit to be promoted over the trees?"
Next, the trees said to the vine, "Come, reign over us."
The vine replied, "Should I leave my wine, which cheers both God and man, to be promoted over the trees?"
Finally, all the trees said to the bramble, "Come, reign over us."
The bramble said to the trees, "If you truly anoint me as king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out from me and consume the cedars of Lebanon."
Now, if you have acted truly and sincerely in making Abimelech king, and if you have treated Jerubbaal and his family well, and have done to him as he deserves;
(For my father risked his life for you and delivered you from the hand of Midian;
And today you have risen against my father's house, killing his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother;)
If you have acted truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him rejoice in you.
But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo and consume Abimelech.
Then Jotham ran away, fled, and went to Beer, where he lived in fear of his brother Abimelech.
After Abimelech had reigned for three years over Israel,
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
So that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal would come to light, and their blood would be laid upon Abimelech, their brother, who killed them, and upon the men of Shechem, who aided him in the murder of his brothers.
The men of Shechem set ambushes for him in the mountains and robbed all who passed by; this was reported to Abimelech.
Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brothers and went to Shechem, and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
They went out into the fields, gathered their vineyards, trod the grapes, celebrated, and went into the house of their god, where they ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech.
Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal? And Zebul, his officer? We should serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve him?
I wish this people were under my command! I would remove Abimelech." He then said to Abimelech, "Increase your army and come out."
When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Ebed, his anger was stirred.
He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, "Look, Gaal, the son of Ebed, and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are fortifying the city against you.
Now, therefore, rise up by night, you and the people with you, and lie in wait in the field.
In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and set upon the city. When he and the people with him come out against you, you may do to them as you find opportunity."
Abimelech and all the people with him rose up by night and laid in wait against Shechem in four companies.
Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelech and the people with him rose up from their ambush.
When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." Zebul replied, "You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men."
Gaal spoke again, "Look, people are coming down from the middle of the land, and another company is coming along the plain of Meonenim."
Zebul said to him, "Where is your mouth now, with which you said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Is this not the people you despised? Go out now and fight with them."
Gaal went out before the men of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
Abimelech stayed at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers so they could not dwell in Shechem.
The next day, the people went out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.
He took the people, divided them into three companies, and laid in wait in the field. When the people came out of the city, he rose up against them and struck them.
Abimelech and the company with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, while the two other companies attacked all the people in the fields and killed them.
Abimelech fought against the city all that day, took the city, killed the people in it, demolished the city, and sowed it with salt.
When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard this, they entered the stronghold of the house of their god Berith.
Abimelech was informed that all the men of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.
He went up to Mount Zalmon with all the people with him, took an axe, cut down a branch from the trees, laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done."
All the people likewise cut down their branches, followed Abimelech, and set the stronghold on fire, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.
Then Abimelech went to Thebez, encamped against it, and took it.
But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of the city fled there, shut themselves in, and went up to the top of the tower.
Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, approaching the door to burn it with fire.
A certain woman dropped a millstone on Abimelech's head, crushing his skull.
He quickly called to his armor-bearer, saying, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that people will not say of me, 'A woman killed him.'" His armor-bearer thrust him through, and he died.
When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each returned to their homes.
Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he committed against his father by killing his seventy brothers.
And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned upon their heads, and the curse of Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal, came upon them.
