Unless the LORD builds the house, those who labor do so in vain; unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
It is futile for you to rise early, to stay up late, to eat the bread of sorrow; for He grants sleep to His beloved.
Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty warrior, so are children born in one's youth.
Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; they will not be put to shame, but will speak with their enemies at the gate.
