I felt joy when they invited me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."
Our feet will stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is closely united:
To which the tribes ascend, the tribes of the LORD, to bear witness to Israel, and to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
For there are established thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those who love you shall prosper.
May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
For the sake of my brothers and companions, I will now proclaim, "Peace be within you."
Because of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.
