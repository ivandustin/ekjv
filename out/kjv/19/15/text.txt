Lord, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy mountain?
The one who walks with integrity, practices righteousness, and speaks the truth from their heart.
The one who does not slander with their tongue, does no harm to their neighbor, and does not bring disgrace upon them.
In their eyes, the wicked are despised, but they honor those who fear the LORD. They keep their promises even when it hurts and do not change their mind.
They do not lend money at interest or accept bribes against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.
