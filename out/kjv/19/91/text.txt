He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will declare of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."
Surely, He will rescue you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.
He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings, you will find refuge; His faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day;
Nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that lays waste at noon.
A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
Only with your eyes will you observe and see the recompense of the wicked.
Because you have made the LORD, who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place;
No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your home.
For He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.
They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
Because he loves me, I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.
He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.
With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.
