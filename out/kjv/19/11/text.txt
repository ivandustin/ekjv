In the LORD I place my trust; why do you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain"?
For behold, the wicked draw their bows, preparing their arrows on the string, to secretly shoot at the upright in heart.
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven. His eyes observe, and His eyelids test the children of men.
The LORD tests the righteous, but His soul hates the wicked and those who love violence.
Upon the wicked, He will rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a terrible tempest; this will be their portion.
For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; His countenance looks upon the upright.
