Deliver me, O LORD, from the wicked man; protect me from the violent man.
They devise mischief in their hearts; they are constantly gathered for battle.
Their tongues are sharpened like serpents; the poison of vipers is beneath their lips. Selah.
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; safeguard me from the violent man who seeks to disrupt my path.
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and they have laid cords; they have spread a net along the roadside; they have set traps for me. Selah.
I called upon the LORD, saying, "You are my God; hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD."
O GOD, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have shielded my head in the day of battle.
Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plans, lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
As for the leaders who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips engulf them.
Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, from which they shall not rise again.
Let not an evil speaker be established on the earth; evil shall pursue the violent man to bring him down.
I know that the LORD will uphold the cause of the afflicted and the rights of the poor.
Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence.
