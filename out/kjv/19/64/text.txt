Hear my voice, O God, as I pray: protect my life from the fear of my enemies.
Conceal me from the hidden plots of the wicked; from the uprising of those who do wrong.
They sharpen their tongues like swords and prepare their bows to shoot arrows, even harsh words.
That they may strike in secret at the blameless; suddenly they shoot at him, and they do not fear.
They encourage themselves in wicked schemes; they conspire to lay traps secretly; they ask, "Who will see us?"
They investigate wrongdoing; they conduct a thorough search: the inner thoughts of each one of them, and their hearts, are profound.
But God will shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly they will be struck down.
So their own tongues will bring about their downfall; all who see them will flee in terror.
And all people will fear and proclaim the work of God; for they will wisely reflect on His actions.
The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and place their trust in Him; and all those with upright hearts will boast in Him.
