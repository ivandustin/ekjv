God stands in the assembly of the mighty; He judges among the divine beings.
How long will you judge unjustly and show favoritism to the wicked? Selah.
Defend the poor and the fatherless; ensure justice for the afflicted and needy.
Rescue the poor and needy; free them from the grasp of the wicked.
They do not know, nor do they understand; they walk in darkness, and all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I have said, "You are gods; you are all children of the Most High."
Yet you will die like mere mortals and fall like any other ruler.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for you will inherit all nations.
