Bow down your ear, O LORD, and hear me, for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who trusts in you.
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I cry out to you daily.
Rejoice the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive, and abundant in mercy to all who call upon you.
Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my trouble, I will call upon you, for you will answer me.
Among the gods, there is none like you, O Lord; nor are there any works like your works.
All nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.
For you are great and do wondrous things; you are God alone.
Teach me your way, O LORD; I will walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name.
I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name forevermore.
For great is your mercy toward me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
O God, the proud have risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought my soul and have not set you before them.
But you, O Lord, are a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy and truth.
O turn to me and have mercy on me; give your strength to your servant and save the son of your handmaid.
Show me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
