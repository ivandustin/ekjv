Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul.
As long as I live, I will praise the LORD; I will sing praises to my God for as long as I exist.
Do not put your trust in princes, nor in mortal man, for there is no salvation in him.
His breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day, his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he who has the God of Jacob as his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God.
He made heaven, earth, the sea, and everything in them; He keeps truth forever.
He executes justice for the oppressed and provides food for the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free.
The LORD opens the eyes of the blind; the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.
The LORD watches over the strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow, but the way of the wicked He turns upside down.
The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations. Praise the LORD!
