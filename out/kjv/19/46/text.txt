God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in times of trouble.
Therefore, we will not fear, even if the earth gives way and the mountains are thrown into the sea;
Though the waters roar and are troubled, and the mountains tremble at their swelling. Selah.
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she will not be moved: God will help her at the break of dawn.
The nations raged, the kingdoms were shaken; He spoke, and the earth melted.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, see the works of the LORD, the desolations He has brought upon the earth.
He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the chariots with fire.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
