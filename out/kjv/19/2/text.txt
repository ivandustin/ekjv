Why do the nations conspire, and the people plot in vain?
The kings of the earth rise up, and the rulers conspire together against the LORD and His anointed, declaring,
Let us break their bonds apart and cast away their restraints from us.
He who sits in the heavens will laugh; the LORD will hold them in contempt.
Then he will speak to them in his anger and trouble them in his deep displeasure.
Yet I have established my king on my sacred hill of Zion.
I will proclaim the decree: the LORD has spoken to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you."
Ask of me, and I will grant you the nations as your inheritance, and the farthest corners of the earth as your possession.
You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall shatter them like a potter's vessel.
Exercise wisdom, therefore, O kings: take heed, you judges of the earth.
Serve the LORD with reverence, and celebrate with awe.
Kiss the Son, lest He become angry, and you perish from the path when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all who place their trust in Him.
