Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your strength and come to save us.
Restore us again, O God, and let your face shine; then we shall be saved.
O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with the prayers of your people?
You feed them with the bread of tears and give them tears to drink in abundance.
You have made us a source of strife to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.
Restore us again, O God of hosts, and let your face shine; then we shall be saved.
You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
You prepared the ground for it, causing it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
The hills were covered with its shadow, and its boughs were like the majestic cedars.
It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the river.
Why have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
The boar from the forest ravages it, and the wild beasts of the field devour it.
Return, we beseech you, O God of hosts; look down from heaven, behold, and visit this vine;
And the vineyard that your right hand has planted, the branch you made strong for yourself.
It is burned with fire; it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
Let your hand be upon the man at your right hand, upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
Then we will not turn back from you; revive us, and we will call upon your name.
Restore us again, O LORD God of hosts; let your face shine, and we shall be saved.
