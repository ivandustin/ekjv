O clap your hands, all you people; shout to God with a voice of triumph.
For the LORD most high is awesome; He is a great King over all the earth.
He will subdue the nations under us, and the peoples under our feet.
He will choose our inheritance for us, the excellence of Jacob whom He loves. Selah.
God has ascended with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations: God sits on His holy throne.
The princes of the people have gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God: He is greatly exalted.
