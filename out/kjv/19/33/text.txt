Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous; for praise is fitting for the upright.
Praise the LORD with the harp; sing to Him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.
For the word of the LORD is true, and all His works are done in faithfulness.
He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
By the word of the LORD, the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He stores the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood firm.
The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He makes the plans of the peoples of no effect.
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen for His own inheritance.
The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.
From the place of His dwelling, He observes all the inhabitants of the earth.
He fashions their hearts alike; He considers all their works.
No king is saved by the multitude of an army; a mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
A horse is a vain hope for safety; neither shall it deliver any by its great strength.
Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy;
To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name.
Let Your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according to our hope in You.
