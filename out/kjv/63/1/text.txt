To the elder, addressed to the chosen lady and her children, whom I cherish in the truth; not just I, but also all who have come to know the truth.
For the sake of the truth that resides in us and will remain with us forever.
May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I was filled with joy to find your children walking in the truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
And now I urge you, dear lady, not as if I were writing a new commandment to you, but one that we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.
And this is love: that we follow His commandments. This is the commandment: as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.
For many deceivers have entered the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
Be vigilant, so that we do not lose the things we have worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.
Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor greet him.
For he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
Though I have many things to write to you, I prefer not to do so with paper and ink; instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. Amen.
