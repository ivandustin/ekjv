And after these things, I saw another angel descend from heaven, possessing great power; and the earth was illuminated by his glory.
He cried out loudly with a powerful voice, proclaiming, "Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and has become the dwelling place of demons, the stronghold of every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hateful bird."
For all nations have partaken of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have engaged in fornication with her, while the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the abundance of her luxuries.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you do not share in her sins, and so that you do not receive any of her plagues."
For her sins have reached up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
Repay her as she has repaid you, and give her double according to her deeds: in the cup she has filled, fill to her double.
How much she has glorified herself and indulged in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, "I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
Therefore, her plagues will come in one day: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly consumed by fire: for strong is the Lord God who judges her.
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will weep and mourn for her when they see the smoke of her burning,
Standing at a distance in fear of her torment, saying, "Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come."
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her; for no one buys their merchandise anymore:
The merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all kinds of fragrant wood, and all manner of vessels made of ivory, and all manner of vessels made of the most precious wood, brass, iron, and marble,
And cinnamon, spices, incense, ointments, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves, and the souls of men.
And the fruits that your soul longed for have departed from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have vanished from you, and you will find them no more at all.
The merchants of these goods, who became rich through her, will stand at a distance in fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
And saying, "Alas, alas, that great city, which was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls!
For in one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin." And every shipmaster, and all who travel by sea, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood at a distance,
And cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, "What city is like this great city!"
And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, saying, "Alas, alas, that great city, where all who had ships at sea grew rich through her wealth! For in one hour she has been made desolate."
Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
And the sound of harpers, musicians, pipers, and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman of any craft shall be found in you any longer; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;
And the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorcery all nations were deceived.
And in her was found the blood of prophets, saints, and all who were slain on the earth.
