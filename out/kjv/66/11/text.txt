And I was given a reed resembling a rod; the angel stood and said, "Rise, and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there."
But leave out the outer court of the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles; they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, dressed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.
If anyone tries to harm them, fire will come from their mouths and consume their enemies; if anyone attempts to harm them, they must be killed in this way.
These witnesses have the power to shut the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy; they can turn waters into blood and strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.
When they have completed their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them.
Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
People from various nations, tribes, languages, and tongues will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days and will not allow them to be placed in graves.
Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, celebrate, and exchange gifts with one another, because these two prophets had tormented those who lived on the earth.
After three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet; great fear fell upon those who saw them.
They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." They ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
At that very hour, there was a great earthquake; a tenth of the city collapsed, and seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake. The survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."
The twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,
saying, "We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is and was and is to come; for you have taken your great power and begun to reign."
The nations were angry, and your wrath has come; it is the time for the dead to be judged, to reward your servants the prophets, the saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.
The temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen within His temple; there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
