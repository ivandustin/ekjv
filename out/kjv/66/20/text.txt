And I witnessed an angel descending from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, known as the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
He cast him into the bottomless pit, shut him in, and set a seal upon him, so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed; after that, he must be released for a short time.
I beheld thrones, and those seated upon them were given authority to judge; I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshipped the beast or his image, nor received his mark on their foreheads or hands; they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection; the second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,
And will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.
They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; but fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them.
The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
I saw a great white throne, and the one who sat on it; from his presence, the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.
I saw the dead, both small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened; another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them; and each person was judged according to their works.
Death and hell were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
