Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel defeated and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
And from the plain to the Sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the Sea of the Plain, even the Salt Sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:
And the territory of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
And reigned in Mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel defeat: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
