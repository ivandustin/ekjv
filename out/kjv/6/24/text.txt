And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem, calling for the elders, heads, judges, and officers of Israel; they presented themselves before God.
Joshua addressed all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Your ancestors lived on the other side of the river in ancient times, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, and they served other gods."
"I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, led him through all the land of Canaan, multiplied his descendants, and gave him Isaac."
"I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau; I assigned Esau the region of Mount Seir to possess, while Jacob and his children went down to Egypt."
"I also sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with the wonders I performed among them; afterward, I brought you out."
"I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea."
"When they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, covering them; your eyes have seen what I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in the wilderness for a long time."
"I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought against you, but I gave them into your hand so that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them before you."
"Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and waged war against Israel, sending for Balaam son of Beor to curse you."
"But I would not listen to Balaam; instead, he blessed you, and I delivered you from his hand."
"You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho, where the men of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites; I delivered them into your hand."
"I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not by your sword or bow."
"I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities you did not build; you dwell in them, and eat from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant."
"Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; put away the gods your ancestors served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve the LORD."
"If it seems evil to you to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve: whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
The people answered, "God forbid that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods."
"For the LORD our God is the one who brought us and our ancestors out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and performed those great signs in our sight, preserving us throughout our journey and among all the peoples through whom we passed."
"The LORD drove out before us all the peoples, including the Amorites who lived in the land; therefore, we will also serve the LORD, for He is our God."
Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve the LORD, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions or your sins."
"If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and do you harm, consuming you after He has done you good."
The people replied to Joshua, "No, we will serve the LORD."
Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD to serve Him." They replied, "We are witnesses."
"Now, therefore," he said, "put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the LORD God of Israel."
The people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey."
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, establishing a statute and an ordinance at Shechem.
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, took a large stone, and set it up there under an oak near the sanctuary of the LORD.
Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; it shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God."
So Joshua let the people depart, each to their own inheritance.
After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.
They buried him in the territory of his inheritance at Timnathserah, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the hill of Gaash.
Israel served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and the days of the elders who outlived him, who had known all the works of the LORD that He had done for Israel.
The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the parcel of ground Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver; it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him on a hill that belonged to Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
