And the entire congregation of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh and established the tabernacle of the congregation there. The land was subdued before them.
Yet, among the children of Israel, seven tribes remained who had not yet received their inheritance.
Joshua addressed the children of Israel, asking, "How long will you hesitate to take possession of the land that the LORD God of your fathers has given you?"
Select three men from each tribe, and I will send them to explore the land, describing it according to their inheritance; they shall return to me.
They will divide it into seven parts: Judah will remain in their territory to the south, while the house of Joseph will occupy their territory to the north.
You shall describe the land in seven parts and bring the descriptions to me so that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
However, the Levites have no inheritance among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their portion; Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, granted them.
The men arose and departed, and Joshua instructed those going to survey the land, saying, "Go and traverse the land, describe it, and return to me so that I may cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh."
The men went and surveyed the land, documenting it by cities into seven parts in a book, and returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there he divided the land among the children of Israel according to their divisions.
The lot for the tribe of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the boundary of their lot extended between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Their northern border began at the Jordan, ascending to the side of Jericho on the north, and continuing westward through the mountains; its exits were at the wilderness of Bethaven.
The border then extended from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, moving southward; it descended to Atarothadar, near the hill on the south side of lower Bethhoron.
The border was drawn from there, encompassing the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lies before Bethhoron southward; its exits were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the western boundary.
The southern boundary began at the end of Kirjathjearim, extending westward to the waters of Nephtoah.
The border descended to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants to the north, and it descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and continued down to Enrogel.
The border was drawn from the north, extending to Enshemesh, then toward Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.
It continued along the side opposite Arabah northward and descended into the Arabah.
The border extended to the side of Bethhoglah northward, with the boundary's exits at the northern bay of the salt sea at the southern end of the Jordan: this was the southern coast.
The Jordan served as the eastern boundary. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, encompassing their territories according to their families.
The cities of the tribe of Benjamin, according to their families, included Jericho, Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
Betharabah, Zemaraim, and Bethel,
Avim, Pharah, and Ophrah,
Chepharhaammonai, Ophni, and Gaba; a total of twelve cities with their villages:
Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth,
Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah,
Rekem, Irpeel, and Taralah,
Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
