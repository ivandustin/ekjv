And it came to pass, when Jabin, king of Hazor, heard these things, that he sent word to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph.
And to the kings who were in the north of the mountains, and in the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west.
And to the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the mountains, and to the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
And they went out, they and all their armies with them, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with many horses and chariots.
And when all these kings gathered together, they camped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver them all slain before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
So Joshua came, and all the warriors with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they attacked them.
And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and chased them to great Zidon, to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; they struck them until none remained.
And Joshua did to them as the LORD commanded him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
At that time, Joshua turned back, took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor had previously been the head of all those kingdoms.
And they struck down all the souls that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was not a single breath left, and he burned Hazor with fire.
And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took, struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded.
But as for the cities that remained strong, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
And all the spoils of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, leaving none to breathe.
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
So Joshua took all that land, the hills, all the southern region, the land of Goshen, the valley, the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same.
From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, even to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon; he took all their kings, struck them, and killed them.
Joshua waged war a long time against all those kings.
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except for the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all others they took in battle.
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, so they would come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no favor, but be destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses.
At that time, Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them along with their cities.
There were no Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did some remain.
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
