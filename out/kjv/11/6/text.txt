And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits in length, twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.
The porch in front of the temple of the house was twenty cubits long, according to the breadth of the house, and ten cubits wide in front of the house.
For the house, he made windows with narrow openings.
Against the wall of the house, he built chambers all around, against the walls of the house, both for the temple and for the oracle, creating chambers all around.
The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle chamber was six cubits wide, and the third chamber was seven cubits wide; for outside the wall of the house, he made narrow ledges all around so that the beams would not be fastened into the walls of the house.
While the house was being built, it was constructed of stones prepared beforehand, so that no hammer, axe, or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.
The door to the middle chamber was on the right side of the house; they ascended with winding stairs into the middle chamber and from the middle chamber into the third.
So he built the house and finished it, covering it with beams and boards of cedar.
Then he built chambers around the entire house, five cubits high, and they rested on the house with cedar timber.
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
"Concerning this house which you are building, if you walk in my statutes, execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will perform my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.
And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel."
So Solomon built the house and finished it.
He built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling; he covered them on the inside with wood and laid the floor of the house with planks of fir.
He built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar; he even built them for the oracle, for the most holy place.
The house, that is, the temple in front of it, was forty cubits long.
The cedar inside the house was carved with knobs and open flowers; all was cedar; no stone was visible.
He prepared the oracle within the house to place there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
The oracle in the front was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold and covered the altar, which was of cedar, with gold.
So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold; he made a partition with chains of gold before the oracle and overlaid it with gold.
He overlaid the entire house with gold until he finished all the house; he also overlaid the whole altar that was by the oracle with gold.
Within the oracle, he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing was five cubits; from the outermost part of one wing to the outermost part of the other was ten cubits.
The other cherub was also ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same measure and size.
The height of each cherub was ten cubits, as was the height of the other cherub.
He set the cherubim within the inner house, and they stretched out their wings so that the wing of one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their wings touched each other in the middle of the house.
He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
He carved all the walls of the house all around with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, both inside and outside.
He overlaid the floors of the house with gold, both inside and outside.
For the entrance to the oracle, he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
The two doors were also of olive wood; he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them, overlaid them with gold, and spread gold over the cherubim and palm trees.
He also made for the door of the temple posts of olive wood, a fourth part of the wall.
The two doors were made of fir wood; the two leaves of one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
He built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.
In the fourth year, the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the month of Zif.
And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts and according to all its specifications. So he spent seven years building it.
