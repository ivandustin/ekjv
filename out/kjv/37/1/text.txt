In the second year of King Darius, on the sixth month, the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
Thus says the LORD of hosts: This people say, "The time has not yet come for the house of the LORD to be built."
Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying,
Is it time for you to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies in ruins?
Now therefore, says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
You have sown much, but harvested little; you eat, but do not have enough; you drink, but are not filled; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages earns wages to put into a bag with holes.
Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
Go up to the mountains, bring wood, and build the house; I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the LORD.
You looked for much, and it came to little; when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you runs to his own house.
Therefore, the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its fruit.
And I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, and on whatever the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands.
Then Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, along with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people feared the LORD.
Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke the LORD's message to the people, saying, "I am with you," says the LORD.
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
