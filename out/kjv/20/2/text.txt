My son, if you will accept my words and treasure my commandments within you;
So that you may turn your ear to wisdom and apply your heart to understanding;
Indeed, if you cry out for knowledge and raise your voice for understanding;
If you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures;
Then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.
For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
He stores up sound wisdom for the righteous; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly.
He guards the paths of justice and preserves the way of His saints.
Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and equity; indeed, every good path.
When wisdom enters your heart and knowledge is pleasant to your soul;
Discretion will protect you, and understanding will keep you safe:
To deliver you from the way of the wicked, from the person who speaks perverse things;
Who forsakes the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness;
Who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perversity of the wicked;
Whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways:
To deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
Who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
For her house leads down to death, and her paths to the dead.
None who go to her return, nor do they regain the paths of life.
So that you may walk in the way of good people and keep to the paths of the righteous.
For the upright will dwell in the land, and the blameless will remain in it.
But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
