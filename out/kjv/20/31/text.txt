The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother imparted to him.  
What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my vows?  
Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.  
It is not for kings, O Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink.  
Lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  
Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, and wine to those who are of heavy hearts.  
Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  
Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are appointed to destruction.  
Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  
Who can find a virtuous woman? For her worth is far above rubies.  
The heart of her husband safely trusts in her, so that he will have no need of spoil.  
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  
She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.  
She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.  
She rises while it is yet night, and provides food for her household, and a portion for her maidens.  
She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.  
She girds her loins with strength and strengthens her arms.  
She perceives that her merchandise is good; her candle does not go out by night.  
She lays her hands on the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  
She stretches out her hand to the poor; yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.  
She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.  
She makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.  
Her husband is known at the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.  
She makes fine linen and sells it; she delivers sashes to the merchant.  
Strength and honor are her clothing, and she shall rejoice in the time to come.  
She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue.  
She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.  
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.  
Many daughters have done well, but you excel them all.  
Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.  
Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her at the gates.
