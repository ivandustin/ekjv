Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars.
She has prepared her feast; she has mixed her wine and set her table.
She has sent out her maidens; she calls from the highest places in the city,
"Whoever is simple, let him come in here!" To him who lacks understanding, she says,
"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed."
Forsake foolishness and live; walk in the way of understanding.
He who corrects a scoffer brings shame upon himself; he who rebukes a wicked man earns a stain.
Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
Instruct a wise man, and he will become wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
For through me, your days will be multiplied, and the years of your life will be increased.
If you are wise, you will benefit yourself; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.
A foolish woman is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.
For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
To call out to those passing by, who go straight on their way:
"Whoever is simple, let him come in here!" And to him who lacks understanding, she says,
"Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."
But he does not know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
