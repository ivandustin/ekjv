Wherefore, laying aside all malice, all guile, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speakings,
As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:
If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
To whom coming, as unto a living stone, indeed disallowed by men, but chosen by God and precious,
You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
Wherefore, it is also contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect and precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.
Unto you therefore who believe, he is precious: but unto those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient: to which they were also appointed.
But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;
Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
Having your conduct honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
Or unto governors, as unto those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of those who do well.
For so is the will of God, that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
As free, and not using your liberty as a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
For this is commendable, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
For what glory is it, if, when you are buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently? But if, when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:
Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him who judges righteously:
Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.
For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
