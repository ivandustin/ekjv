After two days, the feast of Passover and unleavened bread approached, and the chief priests and scribes plotted how they might secretly arrest him and put him to death.
However, they said, "Not during the feast, or there may be an uproar among the people."
While in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive spikenard ointment; she broke the jar and poured the ointment on his head.
Some of those present were indignant and said to themselves, "Why this waste of ointment?"
"It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor." They murmured against her.
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone; why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.
She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him.
When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him.
On the first day of unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He sent two of his disciples and told them, "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.
Wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there."
The disciples went into the city and found it just as he had said; they prepared the Passover.
In the evening, he arrived with the twelve.
While they were reclining at the table eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
They began to be sorrowful and said to him one by one, "Is it I?" Another said, "Is it I?"
He replied, "It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus told them, "You will all fall away, for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today—this very night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you." And all the others said the same.
They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
He said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch."
Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him.
He said, "Abba, Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
And he came, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch for one hour?"
"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak."
And again he went away, prayed, and spoke the same words.
And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they did not know what to answer him.
And he came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise, let us go; look, he who betrays me is at hand."
And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
And he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one; take him and lead him away safely."
And as soon as he arrived, he went straight to him and said, "Rabbi, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
And they laid their hands on him and took him.
And one of those who stood by drew a sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and clubs to capture me?
I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me; but the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
And they all forsook him and fled.
And there followed him a certain young man, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body; and the young men laid hold of him.
And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.
And Peter followed him at a distance, even into the courtyard of the high priest; and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.
And the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but found none.
For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree.
And there arose some who bore false witness against him, saying,
"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.'"
But even then their testimonies did not agree.
And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, "Do you answer nothing? What is it these men testify against you?"
But he kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
And Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?
You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
And some began to spit on him, to cover his face, to strike him, and to say to him, "Prophesy!" And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.
And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came.
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Nazareth."
But he denied it, saying, "I do not know, nor understand what you are saying." And he went out to the entryway; and the rooster crowed.
And a maid saw him again and began to say to those who stood by, "This is one of them."
But he denied it again. And a little later, those who stood by said to Peter again, "Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."
But he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know this man of whom you speak."
And the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." And when he thought about it, he wept.
