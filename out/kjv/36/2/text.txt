Gather together, indeed, gather, O nation that is not desired;
Before the decree is executed, before the day passes like chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD descends upon you, before the day of the LORD's wrath arrives.
Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth, who have carried out His judgments; seek righteousness, seek humility: perhaps you will be sheltered in the day of the LORD's anger.
For Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon will become a wasteland: they will drive out Ashdod at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
Woe to the inhabitants of the coastal region, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, land of the Philistines, I will destroy you, leaving no inhabitants.
And the coastline will become homes and shelters for shepherds, and pens for flocks.
The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they will graze there: in the houses of Ashkelon, they will rest in the evening, for the LORD their God will visit them and restore their fortunes.
I have heard the taunts of Moab and the insults of the children of Ammon, who have reproached my people and exalted themselves against their territory.
Therefore, as I live, says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah, a breeding ground for thorns and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation: the remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my people will possess them.
This will be their fate for their pride, because they have insulted and exalted themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.
The LORD will be fearsome to them: for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and people will worship Him, each from their own place, even all the islands of the nations.
You Ethiopians also, you will fall by my sword.
And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolation, dry like a wilderness.
And flocks will lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern will nest in her upper beams; their voices will echo in the windows; desolation will be at the thresholds; for He will expose the cedar work.
This is the city of rejoicing that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, "I am, and there is none besides me": how has she become a desolation, a resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss and shake their head.
