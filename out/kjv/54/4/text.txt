Now the Spirit speaks clearly, that in the latter times some will turn away from the faith, paying attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons;
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience hardened as if branded with a hot iron;
Forbidding marriage and instructing to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with gratitude by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;
For it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
If you remind the brethren of these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and sound doctrine, to which you have attained.
But reject profane and old wives' tales, and instead, exercise yourself toward godliness.
For physical training is of some value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
This is a trustworthy saying and deserves full acceptance.
For this reason, we labor and endure reproach, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Let no one despise your youth; instead, be an example to the believers in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity.
Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching, and to teaching.
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.
Reflect on these things; give yourself entirely to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
Pay close attention to yourself and to the teaching; persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.
