And it came to pass that when Isaac grew old and his eyesight dimmed, preventing him from seeing, he called for Esau, his eldest son, and said to him, "My son." Esau replied, "Here I am."
Isaac continued, "Behold, I am old, and I do not know the day of my death.
Now, therefore, take your weapons, your quiver, and your bow, and go out to the field to hunt for me some venison.
Prepare for me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, and my soul may bless you before I die."
Rebekah overheard Isaac speaking to Esau, and Esau went out to the field to hunt for venison and bring it back.
Rebekah then spoke to Jacob, her son, saying, "I heard your father speak to Esau, your brother, saying,
'Bring me venison and prepare savory meat for me to eat, so that I may bless you before the LORD before my death.'
Now, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.
Go now to the flock and fetch me two good kids of the goats; I will prepare them as savory meat for your father, such as he loves.
You shall bring it to your father so that he may eat and bless you before his death."
Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, "Behold, Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
My father may feel me, and I will seem to him like a deceiver; I will bring a curse upon myself instead of a blessing."
His mother replied, "Upon me be your curse, my son; just obey my voice and go fetch them for me."
He went, fetched the kids, and brought them to his mother, who prepared savory meat, such as his father loved.
Rebekah took the best clothes of her eldest son Esau, which were in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.
She also placed the skins of the kids on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.
Then she gave the savory meat and the bread she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.
Jacob approached his father and said, "My father." Isaac replied, "Here I am; who are you, my son?"
Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn; I have done as you commanded me. Arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
Isaac asked, "How is it that you found it so quickly, my son?" Jacob answered, "Because the LORD your God brought it to me."
Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, to see if you are really my son Esau or not."
Jacob approached Isaac, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
Isaac did not recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's hands, so he blessed him.
And he asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" To which he replied, "I am."
He then said, "Bring it close to me so I can eat my son's game and bless you." Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank.
Isaac, his father, said to him, "Come closer now and kiss me, my son."
Jacob approached and kissed him; Isaac smelled the scent of his clothes and blessed him, saying, "The smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed."
"May God give you the dew of heaven, the richness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine.
Let nations serve you, and peoples bow down to you; be the master over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be anyone who curses you, and blessed be anyone who blesses you."
As soon as Isaac finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had barely left his father Isaac's presence, Esau, his brother, returned from hunting.
Esau had also prepared a tasty meal and brought it to his father, saying, "Let my father rise and eat of his son's game, so that you may bless me."
Isaac, his father, asked him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn Esau."
Isaac trembled greatly and said, "Who? Where is the one who brought me game and I ate it before you came? I have blessed him, and indeed he shall be blessed."
When Esau heard his father's words, he let out a loud and bitter cry, saying, "Bless me too, my father!"
Isaac replied, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times: he took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing." He then asked, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"
Isaac answered, "I have made him your lord and given all his brothers to him as servants. I have sustained him with grain and wine. What can I do for you now, my son?"
Esau said, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father." Esau raised his voice and wept.
Isaac, his father, responded, "Behold, your dwelling will be the richness of the earth and the dew of heaven above.
You will live by your sword and serve your brother, but when you grow restless, you will break his yoke from your neck."
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him, and he said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
Rebekah, their mother, heard what Esau, her older son, said, so she called Jacob, her younger son, and told him, "Your brother Esau is comforted by planning to kill you."
"Now, my son, listen to my voice; flee to my brother Laban in Haran.
Stay with him for a few days until your brother's anger subsides.
When your brother's anger turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him, I will send for you and bring you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
Rebekah then said to Isaac, "I am tired of living because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women, like these from the land, what good is my life?"
