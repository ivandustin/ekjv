And it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said to him, "My son." He answered, "Here am I."  
Isaac continued, "Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.  
Now therefore, take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver, and your bow, and go out to the field to hunt me some venison.  
And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die."  
Rebekah overheard Isaac speaking to Esau, and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison and bring it back.  
Rebekah then spoke to Jacob, her son, saying, "I heard your father speak to Esau, your brother, saying,  
'Bring me venison and make me savory meat, that I may eat and bless you before the LORD before my death.'  
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.  
Go now to the flock and fetch me two good kids of the goats; I will make them savory meat for your father, such as he loves.  
And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat and bless you before his death."  
Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, "Behold, Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.  
My father may feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; I will bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing."  
His mother replied, "Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my voice and go fetch them for me."  
He went, fetched the kids, and brought them to his mother, who made savory meat, such as his father loved.  
Rebekah took the goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob, her younger son.  
She put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.  
She gave the savory meat and the bread she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.  
Jacob came to his father and said, "My father." Isaac replied, "Here am I; who are you, my son?"  
Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn; I have done as you commanded me. Arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."  
Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" Jacob answered, "Because the LORD your God brought it to me."  
Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not."  
Jacob went near to Isaac, his father, and Isaac felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."  
Isaac did not discern him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.  
Isaac asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" Jacob replied, "I am."  
Isaac said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you." Jacob brought it near, and Isaac ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank.  
Isaac then said to him, "Come near now and kiss me, my son."  
Jacob came near and kissed him; Isaac smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him, saying, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed.  
Therefore, may God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.  
Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you; be lord over your brethren, and let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be he who blesses you."  
As soon as Isaac finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac, his father, Esau, his brother, came in from his hunting.  
Esau also made savory meat and brought it to his father, saying, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."  
Isaac, his father, asked, "Who are you?" Esau replied, "I am your son, your firstborn Esau."  
Isaac trembled very greatly and said, "Who? Where is he who has taken venison and brought it to me? I have eaten of all before you came, and I have blessed him; yes, and he shall be blessed."  
When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father."  
Isaac replied, "Your brother came with subtlety and has taken away your blessing."  
Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing." He asked, "Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"  
Isaac answered, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?"  
Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." Esau lifted up his voice and wept.  
Isaac, his father, answered and said to him, "Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above.  
By your sword, you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck."  
Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will slay my brother Jacob."  
These words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah, and she sent and called Jacob, her younger son, saying, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself, purposing to kill you.  
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.  
Tarry with him a few days until your brother's fury turns away;  
Until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and fetch you from there; why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"  
Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
