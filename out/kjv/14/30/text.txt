And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to observe the Passover in the second month.
They could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, nor had the people gathered together in Jerusalem.
And the matter pleased the king and all the congregation.
So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem: for they had not done it for a long time in the manner prescribed.
So the messengers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the command of the king, saying, "You children of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as you see.
Now do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.
For if you return to the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those who lead them captive, so that they shall return to this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you if you return to Him.
So the messengers passed from city to city through the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
Nevertheless, some of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
Also in Judah, the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
And there assembled at Jerusalem a large crowd to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
And they arose and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away and cast them into the brook Kidron.
Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
And they stood in their place according to their custom, as prescribed by the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites.
For there were many in the congregation who were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the responsibility of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.
For a multitude of the people, including many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon everyone
Who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, even if he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary."
And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
And the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.
And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they ate throughout the feast for seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days: and they kept another seven days with gladness.
For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers who came out of the land of Israel, and dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.
