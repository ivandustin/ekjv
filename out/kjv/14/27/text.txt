Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, following all that his father Uzziah had done; however, he did not enter the temple of the LORD, and the people continued to act corruptly.
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD and constructed much on the wall of Ophel.
Additionally, he built cities in the mountains of Judah and constructed castles and towers in the forests.
He also fought against the king of the Ammonites and was victorious. The children of Ammon paid him one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand measures of barley in that same year. The children of Ammon continued to pay him the same amount in both the second and third years.
Thus, Jotham became powerful because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
Now, the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
And Jotham rested with his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of David; his son Ahaz reigned in his place.
