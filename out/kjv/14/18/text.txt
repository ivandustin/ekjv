Now Jehoshaphat possessed great wealth and honor, and he formed an alliance with Ahab.
After some years, he traveled to Samaria to visit Ahab. Ahab prepared a feast of sheep and oxen in abundance for him and his entourage, and he urged Jehoshaphat to join him in the campaign against Ramothgilead.
Ahab, the king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to Ramothgilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people are as your people; we will fight alongside you."
Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire of the LORD today."
Consequently, the king of Israel summoned four hundred prophets and asked them, "Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or should I refrain?" They answered, "Go up, for God will deliver it into the king's hand."
However, Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of?"
The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, only evil. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imla." Jehoshaphat responded, "Let not the king say so."
The king of Israel then called one of his officers and instructed, "Quickly fetch Micaiah, the son of Imla."
The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, sat on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, in a vacant area at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, while all the prophets prophesied before them.
Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, had made iron horns and declared, "Thus says the LORD: With these, you shall push back Syria until they are destroyed."
All the prophets prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramothgilead and succeed, for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand."
The messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king; please let your words be like theirs and speak favorably."
Micaiah replied, "As the LORD lives, whatever my God says, that will I speak."
When he arrived before the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or should I refrain?" Micaiah answered, "Go up and prosper, for they will be delivered into your hand."
The king said to him, "How many times must I adjure you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
Micaiah then said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. The LORD said, 'These have no master; let each return home in peace.'"
The king of Israel turned to Jehoshaphat and said, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good about me, but only evil?"
Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left."
The LORD asked, "Who will entice Ahab, king of Israel, to go up and fall at Ramothgilead?" One spirit spoke in this manner, and another in that manner.
Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, "I will entice him." The LORD asked, "How?"
The spirit replied, "I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." The LORD said, "You will entice him and succeed; go out and do it."
Now, therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you.
Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek, asking, "Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"
Micaiah replied, "You will see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide."
The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son.
Tell them, 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction until I return in peace.'"
Micaiah responded, "If you return in peace, then the LORD has not spoken by me." He added, "Listen, all you people!"
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
The king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small or great, but only with the king of Israel."
When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "Surely this is the king of Israel." They surrounded him to fight, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God caused them to turn away from him.
When the captains of the chariots realized that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. He then said to his chariot driver, "Turn your hand and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."
The battle intensified that day, but the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until evening. As the sun was setting, he died.
