And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
And say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
I will turn you back, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you forth, along with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in various types of armor, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them wielding swords.
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya will be with them; all of them with shield and helmet.
Gomer and all his bands; the house of Togarmah from the northern regions, and all his bands; and many people with you.
Be prepared, and prepare for yourself, you and all your company that are assembled to you, and be a guard for them.
After many days, you will be visited; in the latter years, you will come into the land that has been restored from the sword, gathered from many peoples, against the mountains of Israel, which have been desolate; but it has been brought forth from the nations, and they will dwell safely, all of them.
You will ascend and come like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your bands, and many people with you.
Thus says the Lord GOD: It will also come to pass that at that time, thoughts will enter your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
And you will say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell safely, all of them living without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
To take a spoil and to take a prey; to turn your hand against the desolate places that are now inhabited, and against the people gathered from the nations, who have acquired cattle and goods, dwelling in the midst of the land.
Sheba, Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, along with all the young lions thereof, will say to you, Have you come to take a spoil? Have you assembled your company to take a prey? To carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: In that day when my people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?
And you will come from your place in the northern regions, you and many people with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company, and a mighty army.
You will come up against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land; it will be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.
Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you the one of whom I have spoken in former times by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days many years that I would bring you against them?
And it will come to pass at the same time when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, that my fury will rise in my face.
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath, I have spoken: Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel.
So that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all men on the face of the earth will shake at my presence, and the mountains will be thrown down, the steep places will fall, and every wall will crumble to the ground.
I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, says the Lord GOD: every man's sword will be against his brother.
I will plead against him with pestilence and blood; I will rain upon him, his bands, and the many people with him, an overflowing rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
Thus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself; I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they will know that I am the LORD.
