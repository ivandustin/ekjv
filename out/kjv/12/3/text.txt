Now Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and he reigned for twelve years.
He committed evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father and mother did; he removed the image of Baal that his father had made.
Nevertheless, he adhered to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which caused Israel to sin; he did not turn away from them.
Mesha, the king of Moab, was a sheepmaster and rendered to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams, along with their wool.
However, when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
King Jehoram set out from Samaria at that time and took a census of all Israel.
He sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to battle against Moab?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I will go; I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses."
Jehoram then asked, "Which way shall we go up?" Jehoshaphat answered, "The way through the wilderness of Edom."
So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went on a circuitous route for seven days, but there was no water for the army or the cattle that followed them.
The king of Israel exclaimed, "Alas! The LORD has brought these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"
But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, "Here is Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to see him.
Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." The king of Israel replied, "No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
Elisha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, if it were not for the presence of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not look at you or see you."
"Now bring me a minstrel." And when the minstrel played, the hand of the LORD came upon him.
He said, "Thus says the LORD: Make this valley full of ditches."
"For thus says the LORD: You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you may drink, both you and your cattle, and your beasts."
"This is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand."
"And you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and you shall cut down every good tree, and stop up all the wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."
It came to pass in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all who were able to put on armor and stood at the border.
They rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.
They said, "This is blood; the kings are surely slain, and they have struck each other down. Now, Moab, to the spoil!"
When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, causing them to flee before them; they continued to strike the Moabites even in their own territory.
They destroyed the cities, and on every good piece of land, each man cast his stone and filled it; they stopped all the wells of water and cut down all the good trees. Only in Kirharaseth did they leave the stones; however, the slingers went around and struck it.
When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
Then he took his eldest son, who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. There was great indignation against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land.
