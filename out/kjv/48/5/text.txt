Stand firm, therefore, in the freedom that Christ has given us, and do not become entangled again in the yoke of slavery.
Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you are circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
For I testify again to every man who is circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.
Christ has become of no value to you, whoever of you seeks justification through the law; you have fallen from grace.
For we, through the Spirit, eagerly await the hope of righteousness by faith.
For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value; only faith that works through love matters.
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.
I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will think nothing else; but the one who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he may be.
And I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the offense of the cross has been abolished.
I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves.
For, brothers, you have been called to freedom; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
For the entire law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
I say then, walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is contrary to the flesh; they are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
envy, murder, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
