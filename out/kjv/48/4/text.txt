Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, even though he is lord of all;
But he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.
Similarly, we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.
But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
To redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive the adoption of sons.
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, "Abba, Father."
Therefore, you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
However, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods.
But now, after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how can you turn back to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?
You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.
I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.
Brethren, I urge you to be as I am, for I am as you are: you have not wronged me at all.
You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I preached the gospel to you at first.
And my trial, which was in my flesh, you did not despise or reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Where then is that blessedness you spoke of? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.
Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
They passionately influence you, but not in a positive way; indeed, they would exclude you so that you might influence them.
However, it is beneficial to be passionately engaged in a good cause at all times, not just when I am with you.
My dear children, for whom I labor in birth once more until Christ is formed in you,
I wish to be with you now and to change my tone; for I am uncertain about you.
Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.
But the son of the slave woman was born according to the flesh; while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
These things are an allegory: for these represent the two covenants; one from Mount Sinai, which leads to bondage, which is Hagar.
For Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.
But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren woman who bear no children; break forth and cry, you who are not in labor: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband."
Now we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
But just as the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now.
Nevertheless, what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son: for the son of the slave woman shall not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman."
So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free.
