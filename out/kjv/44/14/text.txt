And it happened in Iconium that they both entered the synagogue of the Jews together and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
However, the unbelieving Jews incited the Gentiles and turned their minds against the brethren.
Therefore, they spent a long time speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of His grace and granted signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.
But the city's population was divided: some sided with the Jews, while others sided with the apostles.
When an assault was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,
they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region.
There, they preached the gospel.
In Lystra, there sat a certain man who was crippled in his feet, having been lame from his mother's womb and never having walked.
This man listened to Paul speak, and Paul, looking intently at him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." The man leaped up and walked.
When the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
They called Barnabas "Jupiter" and Paul "Mercurius," because he was the chief speaker.
Then the priest of Jupiter, who was in their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifices with the people.
When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting,
"Sirs, why are you doing these things? We are also men with human nature just like you, and we preach to you that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven, earth, the sea, and everything in them.
In past generations, He allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.
Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, for He did good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and joy."
With these words, they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifices to them.
Then certain Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and they persuaded the crowds, and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
However, as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and entered the city; the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
After preaching the gospel in that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.
When they had appointed elders for them in every church and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
After passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
When they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
From there, they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.
When they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them and how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
They stayed there a long time with the disciples.
