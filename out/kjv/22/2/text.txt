I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
Sustain me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am lovesick.
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that you do not stir up nor awaken my love until he pleases.
The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall, looking forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.
My beloved spoke and said to me, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."
For behold, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds has come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with tender grapes give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is lovely.
Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.
My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feeds among the lilies.
Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
