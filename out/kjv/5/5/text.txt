And Moses gathered all of Israel and said to them, "Listen, O Israel, to the statutes and judgments I am proclaiming to you today, so that you may learn them, keep them, and put them into practice."
The LORD our God established a covenant with us at Horeb.
The LORD did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with us, all of us who are here alive today.
The LORD spoke to you face to face from the midst of the fire on the mountain.
(I stood between the LORD and you at that time to convey the word of the LORD, for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) He said,
"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
You shall have no other gods before me.
You shall not make for yourself any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, on the earth below, or in the waters beneath the earth.
You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
but showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
For six days you shall labor and do all your work,
but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. On it, you shall not do any work, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your ox, your donkey, or any of your livestock, nor the stranger who is within your gates, so that your male servant and female servant may rest as you do.
And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.
You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; He added no more. He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
And it came to pass, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness (for the mountain was burning with fire), that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders;
and you said, "Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen today that God speaks with man, and he lives.
Now, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, we shall die.
For who among all flesh has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Go near and hear all that the LORD our God will say; then speak to us all that the LORD our God tells you, and we will listen and do it."
And the LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, "I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you; they have done well in all that they have spoken.
Oh, that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!
Go say to them, 'Return to your tents.'
But as for you, stand here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, statutes, and judgments that you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land which I am giving them to possess.
You shall be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
You shall walk in all the ways that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and it may go well with you, and you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
